<p>

**Michelle Chen:**         Ok, so I think I&#39;m recording. So, basically I have like two sets of questions that I&#39;m trying to combine, but it might just end up just as... I think that it honestly would be better just as like a conversation? So wherever it goes. So I guess the first question is, what year are you at Duke?

**PT:**         I&#39;m a junior.

**Michelle Chen:**         And did you have any computer science education prior to Duke?

**PT:**         Yeah, I did. Um, uh, my dad is a software engineer, so I kind of grew up like knowing about that world but also like I both like took and like taught computer science based classes at my high school. So yeah, I mean it wasn&#39;t like super extensive but then also the summer before I came to Duke I had a documentation internship at um, at uh, an IT automation company where I&#39;m from in Portland, so I did a lot of like software adjacent and stuff there and like was paid for it. So like I kind of had a sense of like, I guess my value as a worker coming into Duke.

**Michelle Chen:**         Did you take any like classes in high school?

**PT:**         Yeah, um only one. Oh my God, I had a python independent study that one, like, so badly because I was fucking around on Code Academy. But I also took a visual basic class my senior year. Um, actually that was a huge mess because my best friend sat next to me and he would always like copy off me, and I like didn&#39;t care because I would just do my own work and he would just look over and like copy off my screen--

**PT:**         Your code?

**PT:**         Yeah. And then we got like scare quotes, caught for scare quotes, plagiarizing and like I got in almost as much trouble as he did. I was like, this is such bullshit. Like he just looked at my screen but he totally took the fall and it was fine, like I mean it was whatever, but it like this whole thing, it was funny. But I also, like I taught a class on autonomous vehicles at my school and so we had to use Arduino, and Arduino is is like a C derivative.

**Michelle Chen:**         So I guess like what did the demographics of that [class] look like in high school? Like male, female wise.

**PT:**         Like all boys. My high school was really, really white. So like, like it was literally 97 percent white I think, um, maybe less. But it was also only 200 students. My high school was really white, but there would be like, like I remember in the um CS class that I like the, when I taught, but also in the one I took, like it would be mostly like white boys and then like um, a couple like women and like some women of color or like I think there was one.

**Michelle Chen:**         Ok. And at Duke, have you taken-- which of these have you taken? 308, 310, and 330.

**PT:**         I&#39;m in 310.

**Michelle Chen:**         And you haven&#39;t taken 308 or 330?

**PT:**         I&#39;m about to take 330.

**Michelle Chen:**         OK. So did your family or do your family and friends encourage you to study computer science?

**PT:**         Uh, yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         Like in what ways or if they do or they don&#39;t.

**PT:**         My like family is like, my dad is in computer science. I, it was always just there. I think for for him it&#39;s like a point of pride that I&#39;m studying this major that&#39;s so like quote unquote useful and like, you know, like of course that is a useful major. I think they wouldn&#39;t care what I did, but like you know, you can tell when your parents are like happy with you versus not happy with you, especially because I have, I do have what I consider like a pretty like impressive professional like resume if not academic at all, but like professionally, like I think they really appreciate that. Um, my friends are like girls like, you know, it&#39;s like girls in STEM. So like haha like. Also my best friend is a computer science major or so we like help each other out.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. Well I guess that leads to my next question which is: who you surround yourself in classes, group work, research experiences, and other aspects of compsci learning?

**PT:**         Like only women. Like I don&#39;t really have boy, like male friends anyway that much. Especially not straight men. I&#39;m just not friends with them but like a lot, a lot of like computer science girls as much as possible but also like in my selective living group I guess just like it&#39;s, it&#39;s random. It&#39;s not necessarily computer science. My closest friend is a computer science major and like a lot of my other friends that I like love and look up to like you like computer science,

**Michelle Chen:**         So I guess, like why do you think you chose those individuals to surround yourself with?

**PT:**         I mean my best friend and I met in compsci 201 [laughs], so that&#39;s why we&#39;re friends. I spent like a year and a half in Pratt so um, that&#39;s where I met like, like it&#39;s freshman year and second year, first semester sophomore year I spent in Pratt, so like that&#39;s who I would spend the most time with. Um, my ex boyfriend is in Pratt so like I would spend time with him and then like in my selective living group, like in Mirecourt we would like-- if I need help with an assignment I&#39;ll talk to the computer science kids and stuff like that. But like other than that, I&#39;ll just be friends with the kids on my selective living groups. So it&#39;s not necessarily like sectioned by major.

**Michelle Chen:**         So you don&#39;t think it&#39;s intentional that you like, especially in comp sci, like to try to surround yourself with women or like not straight men?

**PT:**         No, I just don&#39;t like having male friends.

**Michelle Chen:**         In general, not just in CS?

**PT:**         Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         That&#39;s fair. Me either. All my friends are girls or gay. And then I guess, so then do you think your experience in compsci has been different than most male experiences--

**PT:**         Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         And if so, how?

**PT:**         Wow. I just really said knee jerk, yeah. But like, oh my God. Like I just remember me and my best friend Jasmine, like coming across this realization that it&#39;s OK to be like average, you know. Which like, I don&#39;t think any dude has ever had to be like, &quot;hey, it&#39;s OK to be average&quot;, because like, first of all they&#39;re all already so fucking average.They&#39;re like &quot;I&#39;m so great&quot; and I&#39;m like, &quot;shut up&quot;.  Um, so like there&#39;s that, but then just like, I don&#39;t know, I think it&#39;s a very different experience in office hours, like dudes being really unafraid to like put themselves fucking first on the list or like ask really stupid questions. Like I feel so scared asking a really stupid question and then this guy will be like, &quot;how do I set up my git repo&quot;? And I&#39;m like, &quot;are you kidding me? You&#39;re really wasting all of our time with that.&quot; I would NEVER ask that. Ever. I&#39;d be so embarrassed. Um, yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         I mean, I guess on that, I feel the same way. Do you think like, why do you think that? That&#39;s something I&#39;ve never understood.

**PT:**         Because. Because I think because If I ask something like &quot;um, how do I set up my git repo?&quot;, like something that, like they&#39;re going to be like &quot;This stupid fucking girl. Like why is she here? Just like fucking look it up. Stupid girl&quot;, you know? But like a dude does that all the time and like maybe people like kind of roll their eyes but like no one&#39;s like &quot;this stupid fucking, this stupid boy&quot;.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. And do you think that&#39;s like magnified in compsci though?

**PT:**         Yeah, I haven&#39;t really noticed anywhere else, I guess.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, I mean that&#39;s how I feel to. In some of my experiences, like people literally are like &quot;you&#39;re a stupid fucking girl&quot; and they like delete my code, but if a guy does that, it&#39;s just like, oh, he just didn&#39;t like, you know?

**PT:**         Yeah. Otherwise it&#39;s like, I&#39;ll get like, like I had a TA sit with me for literally like an hour and a half in office hours and some other guy was like, &quot;hey man, can we, um, move the TAs around?&quot; Because that&#39;s a fair question, I agree. And the TA was just like, you know what, I&#39;m going to finish up helping her, and then I&#39;ll continue on. And I was like, [laughs] you&#39;ve spent so much time with me, like why is that?

**Michelle Chen:**         Wait like why do you think that was?

**PT:**         I talked to my friend about it or like my friend who&#39;s a guy who&#39;s also a TA for that class. And I was like, &quot;oh my God, X TA spent like an hour and a half with me I couldn&#39;t believe it&quot;. I was like, &quot;why did he do that&quot;? And he was like, &quot;oh, probably because you&#39;re pretty and a girl&quot;.

**Michelle Chen:**         Oh, interesting. So, but do you think that is helpful? You know, like, or do you think it&#39;s like, like is it something you like?

**PT:**         You know, like if someone&#39;s going to give me extra help for something I can&#39;t control then like fuck it, give me that. You know? Like I don&#39;t care.

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you think was, do you think, do you feel like it was like the situation in 250 where he was expecting--the TA was expecting something to come out of it?

**PT:**         No, because like I also like know the TA, like, like we were like relative, I mean we&#39;re not friends, but I&#39;ve had conversations, and like talked to him and seen him outside of a CS context.

**Michelle Chen:**         That&#39;s fair. OK. So let me see. Um, in what ways is your gender impacted your experiences as a computer science major in classes, or research, or any other CS environment?

**PT:**         I don&#39;t know. I think we&#39;ve just talked about that.

**Michelle Chen:**         OK, yeah, that&#39;s fair. Like beyond classes or office hours do you feel like you&#39;ve seen it anywhere else in compsci?

**PT:**         I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t affiliate myself that much with like CS communities. I used to be on the exec team for hockey, which I left but like I also like that&#39;s not, that&#39;s a programming as in like it&#39;s an events programming committee rather than like an actual, like computer science thing. And like I had ACM but like I just don&#39;t do anything so it doesn&#39;t matter.

Speaker 4:        What about group projects? Have you taken group project based classes?

**PT:**         Yeah like I deliberately choose to work with my friends and then like my friends were mostly women so I&#39;ll have at least one person like on my side. We have like, like in the current, like 310 group, our  third partner who&#39;s a dude, he&#39;s bad at communicating and he&#39;s like, he just ends up doing all the work because he doesn&#39;t communicate to us what we need, but like honestly I don&#39;t care. I&#39;m like, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a gender based. I just think it&#39;s a dude who&#39;s bad at communicating.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, that&#39;s fair. And then do you feel like it&#39;s better to work with only women or like work with other women in cs? Because like honestly I&#39;m asking that just because

**PT:**         I would only ever want to have at least one on my side. Like me working in a group with only boys sounds like hell to me. I just would not do it.

**Michelle Chen:**         That&#39;s like been some of my--that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking because like I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve just been looking back on my experiences and I feel like that&#39;s been some of my...

**PT:**         I would never do it.

**Michelle Chen:**         But some of it&#39;s like, mandatory. Like 308, it was mandatory that I was with a group of four guys and it was, it was terrible. Like there, you&#39;re right, there&#39;s no one on your side, you feel like the stupid girl who can&#39;t ask any questions and then like, I don&#39;t know.

**PT:**         And there&#39;s this like, like dudes love to like pretend. Oh my God, I just remember this one dude who like, he&#39;s ECE/CS so like I had a ton of like CS classes and ECE classes with him when I was still ECE and he was always like pretending like he worked so hard and like literally I had like ECE 110 with him and we like weren&#39;t in the same like you have to like build a robot in a group of two. And I was like, with this kid who like I loved having as a partner, he was like funny and we got along really well. But this other--like, like I felt like I knew what I was doing, I&#39;m like, it was Arduino, so like I had literally had like two to three years of experience with that already. Like I knew what it was up. And like the kid who was my partner, like we worked really well together and like he was able to be like, &quot;yeah, let&#39;s go&quot;. Like it was good. And this kid would come up to us, and be like, &quot;hi, do you need any help?&quot; And we would be like &quot;what?&quot;, and he&#39;d be like, &quot;do you need help with yours?&quot; and we were like, &quot;no, we finished&quot;. And he&#39;d be like really, really surprised and then wander off and they would like come to show that like he didn&#39;t know, like his group was like failing. And then there was like another one.

**Michelle Chen:**         So he asked you if you needed help during this class?

**PT:**         Yes. And then he and then he like his group, like their robot didn&#39;t work. And then there was like another time in the same class where like I was asking the TA to like make a certain part of our project easier. I was like, &quot;oh, can we start on this ramp and then program it to go like basically backwards through this circuit instead of like starting on the circuit and then going up the ramp?&quot;, which is much more difficult to do. I mean I&#39;m like fucking like explaining this so poorly. But whatever. Like basically the Ta was like, &quot;haha, yeah, you can do this&quot;. And I remember complaining and being like, &quot;Ugh, I already coded it the other way, but like, sure I&#39;ll do it&quot;. And this kid, this dude, wanders up and--

**Michelle Chen:**         The same one?

**PT:**         No, different guy. Different guy wanders up and like he&#39;s been like listening and he&#39;s like, &quot;OK, so what you&#39;re going to do is this&quot; and re-explained what the TA had just said to me. And I just stared at him and I was like, &quot;thanks&quot;  and like walked away. I was like, but like me and my partner just laughed about hysterically because we&#39;re like, I can&#39;t believe that just happened. Like and he was speaking just to me. He was like, &quot;what you&#39;re going to do is this.&quot; And literally repeated exactly what the guy said.

**Michelle Chen:**         Did you make eye contact with him? Like why--

**PT:**         He was just standing off to the side.

**Michelle Chen:**         Did you ask, like did you motioned to him at all?

**PT:**         No! [laughs]

**Michelle Chen:**         So he&#39;s literally just came up to you and..

**PT:**         Yes! It was, it was so wack.

**Michelle Chen:**         I&#39;m not surprised. I&#39;m more just like, of course happened to you.

**PT:**         There was one time in EGR 103, when um, I would like with some of the boys in my hall be in the common room during like the Matlab programming and at one point, um, one of the boys was like, &quot;hey pat, did you get this? Like, did you get the question?&quot; I was like, &quot;yeah, I did here you go&quot;, and like passed my computer over to him so he could like, look at what-- I mean, it was fucking 103. Like, is this against the honor code? Yes. I like explained to him my code or my computer was directly in front of him and another kid comes in and he goes, &quot;Oh my God, Patricia, Jack is doing your work for you? Like Jack&#39;s literally typing your code for you&quot;. And I was like, &quot;...he&#39;s copying my code&quot;. The rest of the boys in the room were actually like &quot;boo dude. What the fuck?&quot; Like they like made fun of him, but it just because it was so blatant. But he liked scampered and he liked scampered out the room, but I was just like &quot;are you kidding me?&quot; You think this kid is literally typing code for me? Also like he wasn&#39;t even on my computer. Like he was looking at my computer and typing on his own. And this kid&#39;s like automatic assumption is that he&#39;s doing my assignment for me. Which is insane!

**Michelle Chen:**         Did you know the kid?

**PT:**         Yeah, we were like friends, not the kid I was helping, but the kid who like walked in, he was just being an asshole.  Isn&#39;t that funny?

**Michelle Chen:**         That&#39;s, I mean, yes, funny is a word for it. I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m just like, part of the reason I&#39;m doing this project is because I&#39;m like looking back and I&#39;m just like, there have been things that I&#39;ve laughed about and like shrugged off that honestly, like were pretty fucked up and like really not cool. And like, I don&#39;t know.

**PT:**         I mean, there&#39;s already so much of CS that&#39;s like intensely depressing and unfair. And as I&#39;m like a wealthy white woman with like the most connections in computer science you could ever have, um, so like I&#39;m not going to like take my own experience and be like, ah, you know? It&#39;s been like, because like there&#39;s bigger fish to fry for me.

**Michelle Chen:**         My next question is how do you think your race or race in general, socioeconomic status and other identity factors impacts computer science experiences for people at Duke?

**PT:**         Um, it&#39;s hard for me to even speak for any speak to anyone else&#39;s experience is because mine is so unique. Um, like academically I&#39;m not talented. I think, like I&#39;m just not good at school. That kind of goes like I&#39;m just, I&#39;m just not. Like my at Duke, my focus hasn&#39;t really been academics, and that&#39;s something that I&#39;m fine with whatever. Professionally I&#39;m like-- I&#39;m chewing sorry-- like I don&#39;t think there like an easier higher for interns in the world than me. Like I literally, like the way I got my current internship is like the CEO reached out to me on twitter and was like, &quot;hey are you looking for an internship&quot;? Because I met him out like an open source conference that my dad was invited to like four years ago or like maybe even six years ago.

**Michelle Chen:**         So you feel like it&#39;s hard for you to be like--

**PT:**         I can&#39;t really speak to anyone else but me.

**Michelle Chen:**         Cause you don&#39;t want to be like &quot;woe is me&quot;.

**PT:**         Yeah, cause woe isn&#39;t me. I&#39;m chilling. Like my grades are terrible to be honest and I got really good job offers anyway. So, and like that&#39;s all because of my identity factors. like for me now, even in terms of hiring, like I think being a woman has even helped me because like I&#39;m such an easy like diversity hire that also happens to have a bunch of other like weird assets.

**Michelle Chen:**         Which by the way, why are you recruiting again?

**PT:**         I was going to work in Durham with Colin. I mean, not with Colin, but the reason I was in the area with because of Colin and so I don&#39;t want to be in Durham, if I don&#39;t have to be.  I&#39;m working on a startup in New York.

**Michelle Chen:**         Wait I start June 14th like literally so early. OK like let&#39;s hang out actually.

**PT:**         Mhm. I&#39;m working on the Flatiron district and I&#39;m living in the East village.

**Michelle Chen:**         East village? Oh, that&#39;s a cool place to live.

**PT:**         Yeah I&#39;m excited. I&#39;m subletting from my friend.

**Michelle Chen:**         Wow. Interesting. So you don&#39;t necessarily feel like your like gender, race, gender, socioeconomic has impacted your experiences here? But it definitely does for some people in compsci.

**PT:**         Yeah. I just don&#39;t want to speak to it.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, that&#39;s fair. Um, OK. Let&#39;s see. Do you feel as if there&#39;s a community in which you&#39;re welcome in the Duke CS Department.

**PT:**         No. [Laughs]

**Michelle Chen:**         I love these answers where you&#39;re very like, yes. No, no.

**PT:**         Not at all. I don&#39;t even know what that would look like. I mean the thing is like, like I lead ACM and I choose not to do anything with that because I don&#39;t care. Um, I was on HackDuke, I really don&#39;t feel welcome in the community anymore. It&#39;s something I actively make fun of. Stephanie&#39;s going to Goldman.

**Michelle Chen:**         Really? I haven&#39;t been to a meeting this whole year. Yeah, this whole year.

**PT:**         Well, social good is fucked, right? We&#39;ll both be in New York, I&#39;ll spit on her street if I see her. She&#39;s working for their UX division. I&#39;m like, what UX? She&#39;s cracked as fuck. Anyway, sorry if this interview going to be garbage.

**Michelle Chen:**         No, I&#39;m glad that you were my first because I feel like you&#39;re one of the people who&#39;s OK with me not having this all together.

**PT:**         Well God forbid if you did.

**Michelle Chen:**         OK so you don&#39;t feel like there&#39;s a community in which you&#39;re welcome.

**PT:**         No, but I haven&#39;t like sought one out you know, I don&#39;t like, why would I want to be part of the Duke CS community? Like, it&#39;s all assholes and centrists.

**Michelle Chen:**         Like what--what makes you say that?

**PT:**         Like it&#39;s all either boys who I hate and don&#39;t want to spend time with, or it&#39;s like centrist women who are like, women who code. I&#39;m like OK, whatever,  you know? Like good for you. Kappa Kappa Gamma. Like, cool, you know.

**Michelle Chen:**         Interesting. So do you like--you just feel like the space is full of people that you don&#39;t like?

**PT:**         I think my computer science like goals or whatever or you know, are much more like political.

**Michelle Chen:**         \*drops phone\* Sorry to my transcription.

**PT:**         Um, I think my goals are much more political and I don&#39;t really-- like there&#39;s a couple of people, like individuals who I&#39;ve been very impressed and have like really given me access to some really cool resources. Um, but like as a community, like absolutely not. But that&#39;s all of Duke, you know, like no one to Duke is like particularly like, I mean when I say no one, I don&#39;t mean no one. I think there&#39;s like really great activists at Duke but like the vast majority of Duke is like super centrist and like politically very uninspiring. Like when I think about community, I don&#39;t give a fuck if we have like weekly like Wiring with Women meetings, that&#39;s not what I need. But like instead to have like a radical left computer science community, that would be more interesting to me. But like that&#39;s never going to happen with Duke.

**Michelle Chen:**         Are there places with a radical left?

**PT:**         Yeah, there&#39;s some cool like online communities like um, Tech Solidarity, which is this like um, group that this um, programmer Maciej Ceglowski founded who I really admire but like they like do like political funding for um, like leftist, like non partisan--not non-partisan but non-mainstream leftist candidates which is really cool. And they also are like are pushing for a tech workers union, which is not to like increase funding but rather like a tech workers union that would like give more power to tech workers whose companies like are doing like wildly unfair things, you know, like when Palantir does like predictive policing. If the workers, their workers there have a union then like they can speak out against that.

**Michelle Chen:**         Interesting.

**PT:**         Yeah. Yeah. But that&#39;s the sort of like labor power that Duke students also don&#39;t necessarily have, but like at the same time like, you know, like there&#39;s no one, I don&#39;t know, but like blah blah blah. Yeah. Like I think there&#39;s many reasons that that couldn&#39;t happen at Duke. And I think some of-- like half of them are like Duke students fault, half of them are just like whatever it&#39;s a school, you know, it&#39;s not like we&#39;re doing like labor really. Like it&#39;s not like there&#39;s anything we need to be like fucking unionizing over because we&#39;re undergrads, but like, you know what I mean.

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you think though that there&#39;s something that you need or you want from this community? Like, or are you just like, do you feel like you just don&#39;t want to be a part of them because you don&#39;t need them or do you feel like they could be helpful in some ways, but they&#39;re just not there?

**PT:**         I don&#39;t need them.  Like that&#39;s saying I specifically don&#39;t need them because I don&#39;t need like a &quot;girl gang&quot; quote unquote. And I don&#39;t need networking opportunities. Like if someone else wants that, I&#39;m definitely not like  begrudging them that. And I know that that can be really empowering. It&#39;s just not something I need or want for myself. Like it&#39;s, it&#39;s maybe selfish and it&#39;s maybe just me being realistic.

**Michelle Chen:**         Um, let&#39;s see.  Well I guess. OK. So I do want to ask you specifically, so you&#39;re in 310 now right?

**PT:**         Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         So I want to know about your experiences in that class as a whole. Like when I say 310, like positive, negative, like what? Like what&#39;s your knee jerk reaction? Like?

**PT:**         Um, honestly, like our--this is so bad. I like feel awkward saying this in the interview and having it like be public record or whatever.

**Michelle Chen:**         I can cut it out.

**PT:**         No, no it&#39;s fine. It&#39;s fine. I&#39;m just speaks to like, my lack of academic, like talent. Our like third group member has been doing like so much of the projects for us because he just doesn&#39;t care and he just wants to like bang it out and we&#39;re like, we don&#39;t care enough to be like, &quot;no, let us learn&quot;, you know, like we&#39;re like OK, go, go off I guess. Um, the like it&#39;s called-- ugh God I&#39;m like outing myself in this interview. Um, there&#39;s no way you can put this in and keep me anonymous. It&#39;s called operating systems. So whenever I don&#39;t go to lectures anymore, which is just, I mean, that&#39;s not because of like anything except for--

**Michelle Chen:**         Who&#39;s your professor?

**PT:**         Chase, but like the, like first few lectures, like when he would say like Linux, like people would like look over me and I&#39;d be like, &quot;Hey&quot;, like, &quot;what&#39;s up&quot;, you know, like it didn&#39;t happen that much but like it happened, you know, like sometimes it just happens.

**PT:**         Um, and then like the first, maybe the first week I emailed the professor Chase because I was like, like &quot;can I use my own unix environment? I&#39;ve been using Linux and like I want to use my, like, like I want to use Fedora instead of um Ubuntu&quot;, which is what the class uses. And like I was just wondering if that&#39;s going to work. Like I was, like, of course it will, but like a TA told me it wouldn&#39;t so I just wanted to ask, you know, I was stuntin&#39; a little, um, and he responded back. He was like, &quot;Patricia warm, welcome to the class. Of course I know who you are, but I won&#39;t be mentioning it in class to the rest of the people&quot;. And I was like, thank you so much. Not like I appreciate that discretion and not every student would be as tactful as you, you know?

**PT:**         And then I like went to his office hours to ask him a question about like my code or something and they like, the rest of the kids had been like, waiting out-- this is such a whack story, but it&#39;s kind of funny. Um, the rest of the kids who had been waiting for him were like waiting outside and that like LSRC breakout area and I like rounded the corner and like just opened the door where he was and he was finishing up an email or something like someone else must have come in. And he was like, &quot;give me a second&quot;. And so they were waiting outside and I like rounded the door and opened the door and he was like, &quot;oh, hello!&quot;. And I was like, &quot;hi, how are you&quot;? And he was like, &quot;give me one second&quot;. And then he like immediately, like took, like he closed his computer or whatever and like walked out with me to like break out area. He was looking around. He was like, &quot;uh, yeah, I&#39;m just gonna meet with her real quick and then I&#39;ll come back for the rest of you&quot; even though I clearly just got in there like someone else must have done. It&#39;s like, OK, um, we like went into his office and he was like, &quot;hi, so you&#39;re Patricia&quot;. And I was like, &quot;yes, I am&quot;, you know, I was like, &quot;hey.&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;oh, it&#39;s so good to meet you&quot;. And I was like, &quot;you too&quot;. I mean, he was like, &quot;so what&#39;s the problem&quot;? I was like, &quot;I don&#39;t know, I think I&#39;m just like, fucking like pulling my repository wrong&quot;. I was. Like, it was a fucking git problem it&#39;s embarrassing. And he was like, &quot;just give me your group number and I&#39;ll look over it personally&quot;. And I was like, &quot;OK&quot;, and I like scampered off.

**PT:**         Which like I literally talked to my friend who like does an independent study for him and he was like, that&#39;s weird that he did that for you. I was like, is it? And he was just like, yeah, he couldn&#39;t do that. And I was like, OK, you know. So that was like the first week of class and since then I know that I&#39;ve only let him down with my poor performance in this class and on the mid-terms, so ah, if he&#39;s going to have unrealistic standards for me, I&#39;m just gonna I&#39;m just not going to meet them, you know, and that&#39;s kind of been the vibe there. But yeah, that kind of thing happens sometimes and it&#39;s like,

**Michelle Chen:**         How does it make you feel? I guess I didn&#39;t realize that. Like I forgot. Yeah, that this is a perspective that you could provide because I was thinking more like people in compsci who are just girls.

**PT:**         Sorry, I&#39;m like fucking up your study because this is like a unique perspective.

**Michelle Chen:**         No, I appreciate it.

**PT:**         Um, sometimes you know, like sometimes I just roll with it. I&#39;m like, this is like, I recognize that it&#39;s like, it always benefits me and like it&#39;s like professors giving you personal time and like, you know, stuff like that. Like, like sometimes it hurts my feelings because I&#39;m like, oh, like I&#39;m not gonna live up to your goals. Like, you know, like that suck, you&#39;re setting an expectation for me that I definitely can&#39;t meet. It sometimes makes me feel like embarrassed. Like when Astrachan in our class would be like &quot;Linux&quot; or like, you know, that one time when I was like, &quot;no, this is how it is&quot;. And he&#39;s like, &quot;heheh, I guess you would know&quot;. And I was like [sighs]. Yeah, I didn&#39;t write it, honey, you know, it&#39;s like sometimes a mixed bag of emotions. I like also like I&#39;m really, really proud of what my dad&#39;s accomplished because like I think it&#39;s really amazing and that kind of only becomes more clear as time goes on. That like, holy shit, this is actually really amazing. But like, yeah, it&#39;s just like kind of where we&#39;re at.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, I can see that. That&#39;s. Hm. Do you feel like it&#39;s like a lot of. So you feel like it&#39;s pressure to. Do you feel like he puts like your parents put pressure on, you?

**PT:**         No, my parents like they&#39;re chillin.

**Michelle Chen:**         That&#39;s interesting.

**PT:**         My parents really don&#39;t care. Um yeah I love my parents and how they act about it, which is to say they don&#39;t care and they&#39;re completely normal. Um, uh, what was the question? Like how I feel about it?

**Michelle Chen:**         But I have more, other questions. OK, this is an interesting question that is kind of off topic, but I wrote down: how does, does gender influence how you see your teammates? Because I know you said you like surround yourself with girls, but is there-- like when you see a guy that you don&#39;t know in comp psy, like are you automatically just like, like how&#39;d you find this other guy for your group?

**PT:**         On Piazza. Isn&#39;t that crazy? We found him on piazza because he like just really needed a third because he dropped the group size. Like, oh my god, I&#39;ve never like, our guy is like really good at compsci. Like he does those projects so well, but he&#39;s so bad at communicating and he&#39;s like, like oftentimes like, so... Like faith my other like the girl in my group, um, will like fight him on certain, like coding conventions or certain ways she wants to complete the project. And he&#39;ll be like, no, no, no, and like kinda shut her down. Which like I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s gendered or if it&#39;s just him wanting to do his own thing, you know, like, just because he&#39;s done like so much of the project. Um like, I don&#39;t wanna like ascribe it to gender. Although what can&#39;t be ascribed gender, I don&#39;t know. But like, you know, there was a time where I would like a boy would say something about like cs and I&#39;d be like, oh damn, like he&#39;s probably right. Lately I&#39;ve been like, damn ya&#39;ll are so stupid. Like you don&#39;t know shit, like you don&#39;t know, like fucking Dhruv or whatever will tweet something about like a coding language, and like I think like maybe a year ago I would have been like, I&#39;m so stupid. I&#39;m like, Dhruv, like knows what&#39;s up. Like now I&#39;m like damn, you&#39;re stupid as fuck.

**Michelle Chen:**         Really? That&#39;s interesting. I want to get there.

**PT:**         Like I think like--or like these-- oh my God, Faith and I were studying for the last 310  midterm with these two boys that Faith is close to and one of them is always fucking stepping on my lines. You know, I&#39;ll be like, like some, his friend will be like, can you explain to me how sudo works I have been using Linux my literally entire life. Like my actual entire life. And he&#39;ll be like, &quot;yeah um&quot;, I&#39;ll be like, &quot;yeah, so sudo is&quot; and he&#39;ll jump on my line and be like, &quot;uh it&#39;s a file, which like you change permissions&quot; and I&#39;m like where are you going with this? You&#39;re stupid and you&#39;re also wrong so I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re like, I&#39;m like go ahead and get the wrong answer or like whatever. But like you&#39;re really trying to stunt and you&#39;re shit at this. Like I&#39;ve become very comfortable. I think my role as a junior developer, like as I was interviewing and stuff, I&#39;d be like, &quot;I don&#39;t really know how to do this&quot; during the interview. And they&#39;d be like, &quot;hey, just just look it up&quot;. And I&#39;d be like, you know what? Yeah, I&#39;m a junior developer. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing. And they&#39;d be like, &quot;OK, yeah, sure&quot;. And like kind of like walk me through a little more. But it&#39;s like you know who you&#39;re hiring like you didn&#39;t like, you&#39;re not looking to hire me because like you think I&#39;m not going to act like an intern. You think I&#39;m gonna act like a senior developer.  You&#39;re hiring an intern who&#39;s still in college like so like we&#39;re all kind of stupid and like men especially are so stupid.

**Michelle Chen:**         Like, I mean this is not for the interview, this is just for me, but like how did you, like, how do you get there?

**PT:**         I guess I become like a lot more confident in my professional abilities because I&#39;m like

**Michelle Chen:**         Is it because of your work experiences?

**PT:**         Yeah. Because I&#39;m like three internships deep. And like I also like I know like I don&#39;t have a lot of skills but like some skills I have and like, like you know, I can just like feel comfortable in knowing what I know and also knowing that other people like just love to like stunt. And like if you dig a little deeper into what they think they know, like if you just ask them a few more questions, like, &quot;oh, like what do you mean by that&quot;? Or like, &quot;oh, can you just explain that a little more&quot;? They&#39;re gonna like trip over themselves and get confused because they don&#39;t actually know. It&#39;s like such a surface level understanding.

**Michelle Chen:**         Like I&#39;m like, what did Dhruv say?

**PT:**         Like he tweeted this stupid thing late like it was yesterday and he was, it was like he quote tweeted, oh my phone died. He quote tweeted, like, like, so the original tweet was like software, Stockholm Syndrome. Like when a technology is too bad, like when a technology, when you keep using a technology even when it&#39;s really bad because like you&#39;ve, you&#39;ve taken so much time to learn it and then he quote tweeted it, which means like--is this for the interview?

**Michelle Chen:**         I just want to know.

**PT:**         Like he, like, he like quoted saying like &quot;all of software and Javascript&quot;, which first of all is stupid because like the Venn diagram of like all of software--and javascript is inside that, like it&#39;s not an and it&#39;s like all software, comma, especially Javascript, I don&#39;t know.  But I like responded to it and I was like I disagree because Javascript is both easy to learn--so like directly contrary to this original tweet, and also my favorite language. Like I love Javascript.

**Michelle Chen:**         Did he respond?

**PT:**         Like no, but we talked about it in person. He was like, he was like, &quot;wait Pat, you like Javascript?&quot; I was like, &quot;yeah, I used it for all my technical interviews. I love javascript&quot; Also, it&#39;s easy to learn so it doesn&#39;t make any sense with the original tweet. And he was like, &quot;uh, yeah, I mean I guess I just like, like, you know, I like, like lower level languages&quot; which is classic boy phrase which just means &quot;I&#39;m smart&quot;, like he&#39;s like &quot;I like lower level language cause like C, I mean I guess C isn&#39;t easy to learn or easy to read. But like, I don&#39;t know, I guess it just makes more sense to me&quot; and like, you know,

**Michelle Chen:**         [laughs] so he likes MIPS

**PT:**         Like yeah, yeah, I was like you like MIPS dude?

**PT:**         I was like, you know, like Java scripts are just so extensible and like you get to learn some of the other languages. It was like, oh, I&#39;ve worked so much in node and angular too because of javascript. So like, I don&#39;t know, I guess I just really like it and appreciate it and I also don&#39;t think it&#39;s bad and he was like, &quot;well I don&#39;t know, just different for everyone&quot;. And I was like, fair enough dude, like, but it&#39;s like it&#39;s this little house of cards where like they say or tweet or present themselves in such a way to make themselves seem smart--Dhruv is actually a perfect example. But like if you just like, like you blow in this little house of cards and it&#39;s just like there&#39;s nothing there.

**Michelle Chen:**         So I watched you. I saw you respond to one of his tweets too.

**PT:**         Oh my God. He tweeted about like, oh my  brand is dog memes and Marxism. And I was like never seen you engage in Marxism bro but go off, I guess. Brand yourself.

**Michelle Chen:**         Did he respond to that?

**PT:**         No, he never talked to me. Oh, I tried to talk to him about it but he was really high so he didn&#39;t like react to me. But I was like, you don&#39;t interact with Marxism, nor do you interact with marxist. Like I&#39;m out here in a cultural studies class, like actually thinking and you&#39;re like sitting in your weed cloud like being fucking idiot and like being like ha haha, communism. And I&#39;m like, you&#39;re so stupid. Yeah. I don&#39;t know, like  it&#39;s just this, it&#39;s, it&#39;s become so easy to just like tiny bit like poke at these boys&#39; knowledge and see that there&#39;s nothing underneath.

**Michelle Chen:**         But they present themselves in different ways.

**PT:**         Yeah. That makes you think they do.

**Michelle Chen:**         Maybe it&#39;s because I don&#39;t have enough confidence because I&#39;m thinking about like all my classes where like literally I&#39;ve been explained like this is how it is and this is how it works and you&#39;re just dumb. And then I&#39;m like, yeah, you&#39;re right. Like I&#39;m stupid and I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing.

**PT:**         Yeah I feel really unconfident sometimes too. But like whenever I can like poke at that, like if I even have like that same level of surface level knowledge, like just do it and you&#39;ll see their heads explode.

**Michelle Chen:**         What about, so what is it like, do you feel like this in your internships, like how do they feel different than compsci at Duke?

**PT:**         Yeah, I love my internships.

**Michelle Chen:**         So then like, what&#39;s, what&#39;s different,

**PT:**         My like in my internships, first of all there&#39;s like a sense of fucking professional courtesy, which you don&#39;t get at Duke--

**Michelle Chen:**         But do you actually get that in internship, where people respect your work and

**PT:**         Yes! Well, like, OK, so like my two internships experiences that are actually like aggressively software as opposed to like technical documentation, which is a little different. Like the first one, there were three other interns, um, and a manager like a dedicated manager and then the last one, last summer it was a startup so it was tiny and it was all like, just like older people. But it wasn&#39;t like, it wasn&#39;t a very young startup, you know, like people there were like, like 27 to 30 something, you know, because it was like a medical startup. So they like, like a lot of them were like registered, like pharmacists or like everything else. And then like the engineering team was just a little bit older for it. Um, and in like the um, the one with the other interns like, you know, we&#39;re still like all students we&#39;re still like relatively peers and at one point like the boy, I mean it was a team of three girls and a boy, so I got lucky but they also did that on purpose because it was like they did it as like a professional choice.

**PT:**         But like at one point the boy said something-- like he just used the word like bitch off handedly, but the manager-- like it wasn&#39;t like directed towards any of us, he was like, &quot;oh that&#39;s such a bitch&quot; about something. And like none of us like reacted to it I think. But the manager ended up taking him aside later and being like, &quot;yo, don&#39;t say that&quot;. But also like just the sense of like knowing and being comfortable in the fact that like I&#39;m a junior developer, I&#39;m like a learning person. I got taken on in order to learn and to like bring value to the team in that sense. And not in necessarily a technical skill sense has helped me so much because it makes me feel like, OK, like these people aren&#39;t stupid. They hired me despite knowing that like I&#39;m not going to provide the same value to the team as a full-time engineer because I&#39;m not that and I&#39;m not at that level.

**PT:**         So like being like knowing that fact has helped me so much because it like they hire me because they want low level tasks done because they shouldn&#39;t have senior engineers working on like small fixes that like do improve the service but like waste people&#39;s time if they have like actual, like service architecture to work on, but also to like improve their own mentoring skills which is actually a valuable professional skill to like improve their company&#39;s PR because now they have an intern who&#39;s like out there at a college campus which is a really good recruiting ground. Like bring back full time, which is also really, really valuable. Like all of these things which aren&#39;t necessarily like hard skills that like the company doesn&#39;t need because if they did need it they would hire someone full time.

**Michelle Chen:**         So, I guess like, that&#39;s... Here&#39;s what I was thinking when you were saying that--like you know, how you were talking about like a lot of CS at Duke was like asshole guys, which I totally agree with, but thinking in, sorry, like this is a very disjointed train of thought--in thinking about this project where the guy for 308 appointed himself as like the PM, the project manager in a group of five guys and deleted--he forced to push over my code and like delete my code off like and just like telling me I didn&#39;t know what I was doing and stupid. And like once I was, I told him--have I told you this? I asked him a question. He was like, I just want you to know like you&#39;re a huge waste of my time right now. Like I can&#39;t believe. Like. And he was like, like I know what good design is.  You have no idea. Like it was just like. And now he&#39;s working at Linkedin. OK. And I get that like those are not necessarily

**PT:**         Yeah, but Linkedin is a garbage company.

**Michelle Chen:**         But here&#39;s. But here&#39;s the thing, like these people, these asshole guys are leaving and going into these--that&#39;s the reason why I didn&#39;t want to go into software because--and I get that every tech company is different you can find spaces but does it not bother you that like with every graduating class there&#39;s like the cohort of asshole tech guys going into their asshole tech roles and their hoodies and like they like, you know, like people that we&#39;ve met, like I&#39;m not saying everyone at Interact is like this, but there are people there like that and I was like, like I don&#39;t want it to be.

**PT:**         Yes, I know. And that&#39;s when you see those stories about like, like, like Uber and everywhere else that like it is real Github also. Like that&#39;s where I worked where I had a good experience but like that provides really, really bad experiences for other people. And I know I like, I know, but at the same time like, like there is still a pointed disconnect between a professional experience in which you have like a hierarchical structure. HR, like you know, like at the same time like this kid at Linkedin, like if he&#39;s a product manager or if he&#39;s an engineer, he&#39;s a junior engineer and he&#39;s a junior product manager. He has someone directly to report too that he like, can&#39;t necessarily treat that way. And like, he&#39;s with a new group of people that like, he, he is not like the big fish,  you know,

**Michelle Chen:**         It just bothers me that like people will change how they act. Like they have like a boss

**PT:**         Yeah, I know, I know

**Michelle Chen:**         But it&#39;s like just fundamentally like these--cause they&#39;re still bad people, you know, and like, I don&#39;t know, maybe I&#39;m just thinking too much about it--

**PT:**         No, no I don&#39;t think you are. But like, like these

**Michelle Chen:**         Like these are the people you&#39;re going to like make start ups and like occupy these spaces and that that&#39;s, that&#39;s what really bugs me about it. It&#39;s like I see them and I interact with them in classes. It makes me not want to ever work with anyone like them like in the real world and I guess everyone&#39;s experiences are different though. So that&#39;s,

**PT:**         Yeah. I don&#39;t know, I just like, like I don&#39;t like, I don&#39;t know, like yeah, maybe it&#39;s also that like, especially in professional spaces like I think my presence like carries a little more weight because of my dad, you know, like, which is kind of weird to say. But it does give me the sense of like if I&#39;m gonna like fucking make some sort of bratty little comment, like fine, listen to me, you know, like, like I don&#39;t like I don&#39;t necessarily feel as much at the bottom of the totem pole

**Michelle Chen:**         What about in classes? Do you feel like that holds weight for people?

**PT:**         No, because most people don&#39;t know.

**Michelle Chen:**         Interesting. Do you prefer it that way?

**PT:**         Yeah. And it was something that gave me a lot of grief in the beginning of my professional career. Like people like especially to Github because my dad made git and my mom was just like, you know what, like fine, they like owe him one anyway cause he gave them a platform for their product. So go out there and take it, you know like, like ask the questions and like take it and be grateful and learn like you know.

**Michelle Chen:**         Interesting.

**PT:**         And at Echo, they actually hired me not knowing, but they found out like a little while later they found out after they hired but like they hired me not knowing. So that kind of felt good.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. I guess do your friends share the same sentiments as you about like experiences in compsci and like not feeling welcome in certain spaces or not needing certain spaces or do you feel like your story is very much like--

**PT:**         I don&#39;t know.

**Michelle Chen:**         Like do you guys ever talk about like shitty guys?

**PT:**         Yeah me and Jasmine love talking about how much we hate men, but like it&#39;s just, it&#39;s, it&#39;s never like I wish we had a girls union. It&#39;s just like--

**Michelle Chen:**         these guys suck.

**PT:**         Yeah, you know.

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you wish there was anything different? Like that like tangibly the classes could do. Or like the department could do.

**PT:**         I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s kind of like, like I, I know there&#39;s tons of stuff they could do. I found this document that like this Stanford professor made that like was about like making CS more inclusive for women. I found it my freshman year, and I sent it to my 201 professor, but it was stuff like, like invite women specifically to your office hours if you&#39;ve noticed they&#39;ve done well in on their tests and be like, you know what, you did amazing on this test. Good job. Or like if you like specifically look out for women who are doing well, congratulate them, point them out, even point them out in front of the class. Like, and I remember he did that at one point. He was like, he was at one point he was like, Melanie did amazing on this test. Good job. Melanie, um, which was, which was cool, but like stuff like that and then reach out to women and ask them to be TAs if you notice, like, like don&#39;t like, like stuff like grading distributions and stuff like that, like don&#39;t make it such a big focus because I think like, just be mindful of what you do, like hurts minorities more because they already feel like they don&#39;t belong. But like it was this whole long document of Blah Blah Blah. I send it to my 201 professor.

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you remember what it was called? I&#39;m going to try to find it.

**PT:**         No, but I can find it in my like Duke email probably. Yeah, it was kind of cool. I don&#39;t know if the whole Google doc is still up or anything. It was like my freshman year, but it was nice. It was just stuff that like, like sometimes I hear that CS profs like doing their little tiny best to do it. Like by best I mean nothing at all and they&#39;re like, Oh yes, Barbara Liskov invented view something like I can&#39;t even think of it, some like raft protocol. But like she invented it and he&#39;s like yeah, and she didn&#39;t get any credit for it, which is just foolish. She&#39;s like a pioneer in her field and she&#39;s wonderful. I&#39;m like, good job. He&#39;s like, yeah, and I just know like women in cs have to work so much harder. I&#39;m like, you know what you&#39;re saying words but like damn, like, I don&#39;t know. She seems dope. Right? Like she seems super smart, but I would like more tangible support maybe, you know.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, that makes sense.  Any final thoughts?

**PT:**         Oh and I know like Phillip Moss, who I really admire, he held like, like black CS office hours where like, it was just for like black CS kids at Duke like you know what I mean and apparently it was cool. So that&#39;s an excellent.

**Michelle Chen:**         I, I&#39;m interviewing him for this too.

**PT:**         Good, I mean I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll bring it up hopefully, cause he should.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. Well thank you.

**PT:**         You&#39;re welcome.

**Michelle Chen:**         That was, for someone who was like, Oh, I should&#39;ve thought about that. That was very--I know I&#39;m peeling everywhere Patricia and also my hands are peeling. I don&#39;t know if you can see.

**PT:**         My palms are so dry. I don&#39;t know why.

**Michelle Chen:**         I didn&#39;t know that my hands could do that. Like I don&#39;t know why my whole all my skin&#39;s peeling.

**PT:**         Oh the interviews kiss kiss! Wow,  45 minutes. Should I end it?

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

<details><summary>Interviewee 2 - AW </summary>
<p>

**Michelle Chen:**         Ok. So I explained the project, so I guess my first question is 308, 310, and 330. Have you taken all of the and what order did you take them in?

**AW:**         I have. Uh, 308 and then 330 and then 310.

**Michelle Chen:**         Cool. And what year are you at Duke?

**AW:**         Uh, I&#39;m a senior.

**Michelle Chen:**         Ok. So did you have any compsci like education prior to attending Duke?

**AW:**         Uh, yes, I had one year of AP computer science in high school.

**Michelle Chen:**         And like what, what, like what was that experience like and what were the demographics of that class?

**AW:**         Uh, that class was mainly white and East Asian men, uh with some white East and South Asian women and probably like three to one to four to one, it was a couple years ago now. Um and it was fine. It was super easy. Uh, the professor or teacher I guess was extremely understanding and so--I actually think he&#39;s probably the best--I think he&#39;s probably the best compsci teacher I&#39;ve ever had as far as a pure teacher teacher because he understood kind of the difficulty that the students would have with learning this sort of stuff at a very beginning level. So the class was taught in Java, like Basic Java for a semester, then data structures and algorithms for a semester and every assignment was completion. Every could be submitted whenever, just by the end of the year, every test could be retaken as many times as you wanted to. So he made it very easy for you to get a good grade. And he understood that like people, you know, largely pursued programming in high school with the intention at least while they were learning it to be able to make or do something. And so the class, he didn&#39;t really have to worry about using grades to incentivize people. If people couldn&#39;t get something to work, that was the, all the incentive they needed. And so he did a very good job of like making sure that people felt um like there was no other pressure except for that. Yeah, supported for sure.

**Michelle Chen:**         Um, do your family and friends encourage you to study cs?

**AW:**         Um, no.

**Michelle Chen:**         Did your parents?

**AW:**         No, not at all.

**Michelle Chen:**         So, like why did you decide to--

**AW:**         I didn&#39;t in high school I started when I was in college because um, because I could and I thought I was good at it and I think I was really lucky taking compsci 201 in Java as a freshman in the fall where I had already essentially taken a data structures course in Java in high school, so I knew more than a lot of the sophomores because they had taken compsci 101 which is in python, so I had like a pretty strong understanding of Java Syntax and I had no problem. Um, like we, I went, I went like off campus, on of my third or fourth weekends at Duke with a bunch of sophomores in this club I got involved in and we like did homework the first afternoon when we got there and I was able to help like five sophomores on their compsci 201 homework even though like I was just like freshman and that was like super empowering for me. So that&#39;s probably why stuck there at first.

**Michelle Chen:**         And your parents, don&#39;t haven&#39;t like, like don&#39;t care at all?

**AW:**         My parents set the requirement basically that I had to make sure that I could support myself after college and um, and whether or not that was through my major was never really a concern I guess. I don&#39;t know if that had to be through my major or not because I ended up picking a major where that was pretty easy. So I guess I never had to test them at all to see if they would care or not.

**Michelle Chen:**         So I guess in, in comp sci classes, group work, research experiences, whatever your experiences have been in compsci at Duke, who do you surround yourself with?

**AW:**         That&#39;s an interesting one. So I think at first-- I can go, I can go backwards. So I think junior, senior year it was people that I know that are smart because they could help me. I think freshman, sophomore year it was more social based, it was like more people that I want to be friends with and I think the social thing is just like a me thing. I think that&#39;s just like my natural tendency at least was at the time and I think it shifted to like people that are smart because the classes got harder and I needed that help. Um, so that was kind of like how it changed and it was relatively easy to do both those things. But I wouldn&#39;t say that I developed very good friends, like explicitly through comp sci. So the people like freshman, sophomore year, then I surrounded myself with that I wanted to be friends with, I ended up being friends with because we connected over other things.

**AW:**         Um, I don&#39;t think like being a software engineer, being able to code was that part of my, like non-academic life at Duke.

**Michelle Chen:**         And so I guess like is there a certain demographic type? Or like

**AW:**         Ah, yeah I think it&#39;s mostly East Asian or white people? Uh, mostly men, but I mean like I think it&#39;s just like a one off thing, like some of my closest friends, like people that I&#39;m closest to that I met through a campsite, like some of them are, are, are like--yeah of the closest people like I would say half are white, and some are queer. So like it&#39;s not just like the straight white guy and straight East Asian guy.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. And so I guess you sort of brought up the second part of this question, but it was: like why did you choose these people to surround yourself with? And so your answer is at first you wanted to be friends with them, and then you realize they&#39;re smarter. And then, how did you identify who you thought was smart? Just by like word of mouth? Like you saw their performance?

**AW:**         Oh yeah, I think it was, I mean it would be just like I would ask people around me for help and every now and then someone&#39;s response would like blow me away and like just taking with me that they were like, wow, this person&#39;s really freaking smart and I&#39;ll just go ask them for questions because they can explain things well. Um, I don&#39;t think I sought people out. It was more just like I just kinda like floated around on my own until I ran into people that knew what they were doing. I also like didn&#39;t rarely ever consult people who had taken the class in the past because just like people forget stuff and they&#39;re not really that helpful. So.

**Michelle Chen:**         Um, do you think your experience in the computer science major has been different from most female students&#39; experiences?

**AW:**         Yeah, definitely. I mean every professor was my gender. Um I remember in 308, of the three group projects teams, I did one with one male and one female, one with two males and one female and one with 10 males and one female. So, and that the woman in the last group was the same as the woman in the second to last group. So in a course where I worked with in theory, three different teams of varying sizes that I worked with two women total and those teams where it&#39;s three, four, and 12 people.

**Michelle Chen:**         So what about in terms of like--

**AW:**         Oh yeah, yeah, sorry. thinking back to the original question, um...

**Michelle Chen:**         I guess like how do you, how do you think your experience has been different?

**AW:**         Yeah, yeah. Well like. I want to try to-- do you are you, do you want this to be something that can be played back to someone or it&#39;s just for your notes?

**Michelle Chen:**         No so basically I did an interview with someone where I was like typing the whole time and it  didn&#39;t feel like the conversation.

**AW:**         Ok, got you.

**Michelle Chen:**         So this is like for my notes when I type up.

**AW:**         OK. I actually look at you while talking because I&#39;m like trying to phrase this as if it&#39;ll be played back.

**Michelle Chen:**         I mean if someone wants to listen to you, I mean do you care?

**AW:**         No, I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t care. But it&#39;s just more of like some things I can like go back and reference things that you&#39;ve been through, but like if you play this to someone and they don&#39;t know who you are it&#39;ll just be weird.

**Michelle Chen:**         No, it&#39;s just for me and I guess my professor could listen to these if you wanted to, but it&#39;s going to be like, many hours of like...

**AW:**         Yeah, well also like I&#39;m about to say like some like, I don&#39;t know. Just like thinking about like social justice terminology versus like I don&#39;t know.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah this is for me.

**AW:**         Um, so I guess I&#39;ll try to articulate what I think is the way that I would articulate it and this is-- this is rarely articulated, is just throughout every step in the process, men are able to be validated and supported in what they do by people that look like them--sorry--by people that share their gender and women aren&#39;t like that aren&#39;t, but like that aren&#39;t, like has to be couched--and I&#39;m not saying that women are told outright that they can&#39;t succeed. Like that would be like a little bit-- that&#39;d be, that&#39;s kind of like a contrived way of thinking about it. It&#39;s literally just the absence of being told something. Right? And I think it&#39;s a large, like the large amount of the issue. And don&#39;t get me wrong, like there are definitely very harmful incidents that happen to women that are like actively negative, right? And I won&#39;t try to deny those, but I would say that like the largest portion of the attrition and my eyes comes literally just from like, you can call it, lack of support, lack of like empowerment, whatever.

**AW:**         But it&#39;s just imagine like if it&#39;s, if it&#39;s like a race or like a, a path or whatever you want to call it and men are being like slightly tapped up words like the entire time and women just aren&#39;t, then there&#39;s going to, there&#39;s going to be this divide that happens. And then of course like all Duke students we&#39;re always comparing ourselves to people around us in terms of like thinking about how you do this, right? Like in terms of thinking about how capable or like basically whether or not we&#39;re inferior or if we fit in. And I think both of those things. Um, I mean it&#39;s not as if like women would only compare themselves to other women, right? Like they obviously would compare themselves to all their peers and when they see a lot of other peers ahead of them, that can be truly demoralizing, it can be otherizing and can be marginalizing. I mean it&#39;s just, it&#39;s very, um, and I&#39;ll be honest like I wish I had thought about this more at like a very specific level because I think like the practical implementation of this, like I can&#39;t immediately tell you. I think part of my answer or the reason why it&#39;s this blanket, like &quot;it&#39;s not something that&#39;s happening, it&#39;s just something that&#39;s not happening&quot; is because I honestly couldn&#39;t tell you the link specific active things because I haven&#39;t been looking for it.

**Michelle Chen:**         Like do you feel, I mean this is just my curiosity, but do you feel like it&#39;s a different experience working with like females versus males? Do they act differently? Do they work with you differently? Do they like ask you more questions?

**AW:**         Oh, definitely not. No, not in that sense. And like I know this isn&#39;t exactly what you&#39;re asking about. Like one like tangible way this could be done like this can be compared is like if you were working long distance with someone, right and you never saw them in person and they had like a gender ambiguous name. Could you tell? Probably not. I think it&#39;d be really interesting to ask Shelley Vohr about this because I think Shelley&#39;s, so shelley works for github and works remote and I think her slack handle is like a username. It&#39;s not &quot;Shelley&quot;. So I&#39;d be really curious to see because she effectively gets to have a gender blind software engineering experience or like something close to it, you know, that&#39;d be something like-- I&#39;m sure that people actually worked with her, you know, know her gender, that sort of thing. But in my experience I think there&#39;s something noticeable, which is I guess good and bad, right? Like good that I&#39;m not noticing things, but bad probably because there&#39;s like some implicit biases I don&#39;t even notice. Um, I&#39;m more treating your question to think about like do I have to like do like feel like I have to act any differently than I do? Do I feel have to treat them any differently? And I feel like, hm.

**AW:**         So like my, my, my initial reaction would be like if I put on my, like attempting to like, like if I put on my identity issues or like gender equity hat, then yes, I think so, right. Like I have worked in groups with women before where I actively tell them to not apologize, but I&#39;d be curious I guess to think about how even the way I do that is harmful, you know, like I think I&#39;ve learned a lot because of a couple of women, who I&#39;ve been lucky enough to work who have had the patience to like help me learn how to be better at learning about these issues, which is like really nice. Yeah, I don&#39;t think I see them any differently.

**Michelle Chen:**         So I guess the motivation behind this question is sort of like, I just feel like guys in compsci are so confident. Like they&#39;re very, they think that, not that they can do no wrong, but they&#39;re just like. So--even if they have no idea what they&#39;re talking about, they&#39;re like very, very confident in everythin that they say. Like when I, when I worked with women, a lot of times they&#39;re like, oh, like I&#39;m not sure, I don&#39;t know. And so I guess I was sort of looking at it from that perspective in which like, I feel like gender does impact experiences here.

**AW:**         Definitely, but I don&#39;t know how much of that comes from the way men see, well sorry. I don&#39;t know how much of that in the individual interaction where I&#39;m like, &quot;Hey Michelle, what are you thinking about this?&quot; And you&#39;re like, &quot;oh, I don&#39;t know&quot;. Like I don&#39;t know how much of that comes from either one party thinking the other party in a different way. Right. I think that&#39;s like definitely something that is enforced by gender dynamics that uh, that might men help perpetuate. But I don&#39;t know if like in the moment it&#39;s like a-- I don&#39;t know if in the moment I could do something differently that would not making you a response.

**Michelle Chen:**         Right.  That makes sense. I mean, so then does gender influence how you see teammates at all? Or is it just really just you&#39;re like--

**AW:**         Ah, yeah, hm. I don&#39;t think so. I mean I&#39;m trying to like find, think of like the textbook problematic examples and then switch up like a woman out for a male in my mind and see if I would think of them any differently. And... I mean, so if you&#39;re asking about like actively, do I think anything differently? No, I don&#39;t. I&#39;d be more curious to see like if because of like indirectly are the second order effective you know someone who apologizes for like doubts themselves more if I treat them a certain way. Right. And I&#39;d also say that like, yeah, confidence is an interesting thing, right? Because I think it&#39;s like even when they&#39;re like ignorant or like blindly confident they&#39;re competent and I&#39;m not going to say if it&#39;s better or worse, I think it&#39;s worse but I don&#39;t actually know. But I think I think this confidence is good or bad. I&#39;m leaning towards bad and I&#39;m not sure, but I think a lot of the confidence men have comes from-- or relative difference in confidence men have-- comes from always being supported and number having to doubt themselves, which is shitty, but also makes me wonder like, like if the net effect is women ended up messing up, or men end up--the net effect is men end up messing up more than women because of that like blind confidence. Right? And the question for me would be to then say, well obviously no, I&#39;m not a proponent of life women, shouldn&#39;t be confident, but it&#39;s more of how can you reframe like, I don&#39;t know, I think the ideal would be like in compsci, everyone second guesses--not second guesses but like everyone checks everyone else. Um, but in a non-negative way, right? Because like what you&#39;re talking about, of like, you know, a woman frequently being like, I don&#39;t know, like I want to double check with someone. Like that&#39;s couched in ultimately like some feeling of probably some like insecurity and like that&#39;s not good, but like the functional outcome of people now check, like have the to need to check their work I think is good. And that may be the result of that. Maybe the reason why women ended up being, I would very much not be surprised if women are actually like-- if there was a way to measure like how many mistakes they made, women probably make less mistakes than men. But like right now that happens because of a really shitty reason that is couched in insecurity and the ideal world would be--I&#39;d like that to like the ideal world would be, You have the error checking, you don&#39;t have the insecurity and then that goes across the board. So like men are overly confident but don&#39;t check their errors and that ideally that would be like a cautious optimism as well.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, I guess so talking about other identity factors, how do you think your race or socioeconomic status or any other identity factor besides gender has impacted your CS experience?

**AW:**         Um, so I think the first thing that comes to mind for SES is that a lot of people pursue computer science because it&#39;s lucrative and that comes with certain benefits or negative externalities. But just like that comes with certain differences in mindset than mine because I&#39;m lucky that while my parents would say like, you need to pursue something that will support you, I&#39;ve never felt-- I come from like a athletic background, so I never had to feel that urgency and I think that&#39;s given me definitely a lot of privilege in the sense that I don&#39;t have to worry about it as like a, I have to do this because it will make me money in the same way that like, I also don&#39;t have to worry about like being a consultant or being a banker to make money. Right. All right, I guess what I mean by that is like, I think it makes a difference but it doesn&#39;t make a difference so much in the fact that I&#39;ve chosen compsci.

**AW:**         But like, once I&#39;m in it, like how I think about it, like how, how much urgency there is. Um, and then as far as race goes, not really, but maybe that&#39;s just because I think maybe that&#39;s because I&#39;m a PM. And so I think of it as like, I suppose if I like have subconsciously bought into the uh, Asian awkward programmer, like male, Asian male, awkward, like socially awkward programmer stereotype. Like I feel like that doesn&#39;t apply to me both in terms of my actual occupation because I don&#39;t have the job of a programmer, but also like that&#39;s not how I see myself. I would consider to be like I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t see myself as socially awkward. So like those things also I think afford me a certain amount of confidence in how I interact in the tech world.

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you feel as if a community in which you feel welcome in the Duke CS department?

**AW:**         Uh no,  but also like I&#39;ve really never wanted to interact with the Duke CS department.

**Michelle Chen:**         Why?

**AW:**         I don&#39;t know. I think at first like freshman, sophomore year it was-- they&#39;re all about theory and I just want to code so they can&#39;t help me. And then junior, senior year it was &#39;I&#39;m going to do PM and they don&#39;t know anything about that&#39;. Um, what was the question? Do I feel supported? Or do I think I have a community in which I feel welcomed? Oh, OK. Well like, yes. I&#39;m sure I would be welcomed, but I have never engaged with that. Like I never really never interacted with any, any part of the comp sci department like socially. Yeah, like yes I TA&#39;d but like, like let&#39;s eat pizza and grade and that sort of thing, like I think I had a little bit of like the, like the analogous term would be like internalized racism except like internalized, like programmer phobia or whatever of like seeing the stereotype of the awkward, like socially awkward asian nerd programmer and being like, I don&#39;t want to be a part of that. So I just surrounded myself with socially and like I found community in people that just weren&#39;t that.

**AW:**         And I have no problem with that. But I think to the original question, yes there is a community. So I should be clear. Yes, there&#39;s a community where I would feel welcome, just not--

**Michelle Chen:**         But you don&#39;t want to be a part of it because you don&#39;t want to be seen as a stereotype?

**AW:**         I think at first I was the reason and then after awhile, I mean now like intellectually now, no, that&#39;s not why. I just have friends elsewhere. Right. Like, I don&#39;t see any value--like if the value if the value proposition is like community, friends, networking, professional mentorship, academic mentorship, like I&#39;ve gotten all those things through things that aren&#39;t the department. Right? It&#39;s like HackDuke, professors. Like I&#39;m good friends with Alex Hardiming on a one to one basis. Like, there&#39;s my, like academic, I suppose if I ever needed something there. Um, I never particularly been interested in research or I&#39;ve never been involved in it. So I&#39;ve never had a need for that. So yeah, I&#39;d say probably at the beginning there was a little bit of like internalized, like distancing from a stereotype and now I mean now I have no problem with them, but I just don&#39;t just don&#39;t need it. I already have time, like spent the time everywhere else.

**Michelle Chen:**         In terms of specific classes, like when I say 308, 310, 330, like what, what do you think of when you think of those three classes?

**AW:**         308, everyone says it&#39;s hard. I found it very easy. I think the reason why I found it easy was one, like how all the social privileges stacked up for me. Namely like, like I always felt supported right. And then in terms of in actuality, I also happen to enjoy just like coding in Java and then the next layer down was I saw it as ultimately like a class in like teamwork and team dynamics and working on software projects as a team. And so what I have told every underclassmen asking me about that class since is for me, I saw the way to do well in that class as to um, collaborate well, figure out what people&#39;s strengths and weaknesses are and try to optimize for strengths and like having that planning conversation at the beginning and understanding when people are busy and not busy and understanding when someone&#39;s going out of town for like some event, um, that was something that I thought it was kinda like came relatively natural to me.

**AW:**         And so then what I did have to do, like, you know, I did, yes, I like pulled like two, 10 hour days like for each of the projects. But it was fun and I also think I was only taking four courses and I had the like patience and availability to work on them. So yeah, I mean it was fun and yeah, I don&#39;t think I got that much out of the course in terms of like the technical concepts I like to do kind of regret that because I think a lot of the articles that Duvall shared, I just didn&#39;t read. That talked about a lot of like software like programming concepts like very, very thoroughly, right, so talking about things like good scoping or like MVC or like proper ways to do extractions or like serialization or reflection of like these are all concepts I could have learned and like the ones when I did interact with them it was literally just through like I didn&#39;t want to read the articles. I just looked at examples and kind of understood it intuitively. So that&#39;s a bit different. 330 I went in accepting what I was going to get a B, I kind of PAID attention in class, but not really because it seemed kind of hopeless. I went to the TA, got like help on the homework, turned in every homework, like scored exactly average on the exam. Got a B, like had no, I had no problems with that going in. I think the thing about algorithms, and I don&#39;t blame the professor, he was a great professor, but the concepts are also modular. They don&#39;t really stack on each other and they&#39;re all like so unintuitive that it&#39;s very hard for I think someone who hasn&#39;t--

**AW:**         Like he way I kind of think about it, it&#39;s like given a set of problems like, like algorithms problems, right? I think you just have to see a lot of them before you can like start to recognize any of them, right? It&#39;s not like, oh, like graph traversals-- I need to see like three graph traversal problems before, you know, I can do graphs traversal. Because I think that was the approach the homework set us up for it and I think in reality it&#39;s like you need to take algorithms like three times as a course and then you can do any of the problems probably fine, but your just--brain just won&#39;t get into that like analytical problem solving, you know, like how can I pull these algorithms apart and think of them a series of step? I just don&#39;t think you can accomplish that in one semester. I also took--I took 330 after 260, which I think um, because we, a professor Hardiming taught us a lot of algorithms in 260, I think actually gave me a huge leg up when the content didn&#39;t overlap. So like dynamic programming for me it was very easy because we learned dynamic programming like with a one dimensional dynamic program like DP table and we did that problem by paper both in the homework and the exams. And in Professor Hardiming&#39;s class we implemented a three-dimensional is one dynamic programming table. Right? So like being able to do that, I think it was super beneficial but only for that specific problem. Like that didn&#39;t help me with anything else even though I&#39;d taken that course. 310, super interesting, wish I paid attention-- like wish I made it to class more. But the lectures were very interesting and same thing with 250--it was all very interesting because there&#39;s not, there&#39;s not too much intuition required. It just like, you just learn how it works and that&#39;s just how it works. And then I think I really enjoyed thinking about like reordering of the locks and the conditional variables because I think that was a part where it wasn&#39;t just this like formulaic thing like the processor in 250. It was actually kind of like intuitive about like, yeah, like the ordering. I thought that was pretty cool. Um, but otherwise it was very much just this is how it works, do it.

**AW:**         Did you think it was hard to for help in any of those classes?

**Michelle Chen:**         Uh, no.

**AW:**         And how could any of them have been better beyond what you told me? Or--or do you think they&#39;re fine as they are?

**AW:**         I mean they probably could have taught less in 330. Less breath, more depth. I still think 330, would not have accomplished what it tries to accomplish. I just don&#39;t think you can do it a semester for most people, which is like, I don&#39;t know, algorithms well, but if you really want people to have like a good understanding of algorithms, they have to do it for a long time and like the reason why I say less breadth, like fewer algorithms, it&#39;s just so you can practice more with those specific examples and even then that will not be applicable outside of those examples, but I mean at least like this is a little bit of a crude abstraction, but it&#39;s like at least you can know like five algorithms well enough to like do problems that are very slight tweaks on those five algorithms. It&#39;s not going to help you with anything else, but.. And then 310 was fine. 330, I mean, sorry 308, Oh, well, the thing about 308, my perception of it was like the code was almost irrelevant. What you, what you actually wrote. It was entirely in the write up, which is also probably a large part of why I had so much fun with it because like for the code, I just wanted things I want--well no, that&#39;s not fair. I think it was, I was very lucky that some of the stuff was easier for me and then on top of that I just had fun with it. So like for the second and third projects I did front end and I had a ton of fun just like making all the buttons resize dynamically resize as I resized the size of the window and then the writing part I wrote about things completely unrelated to that and I probably spent like an hour on total and I made it sound nice and I got an A.

**AW:**         So that was kind of frustrating because I think depending on what Duvall is going for, um, like yeah. I actually respect the guy a ton. I think what he&#39;s doing is like often criticized but like hard, right? Because like it&#39;s kind of like, it&#39;s an inherently, like-- software engineering or development is inherently like this, like alinear amorphous, like multifaceted topic. But I think it would&#39;ve been nice if we had tried to focus on one specific set of things and then like optimize all of that. Right. So for example, the, the course is about software design. I say the most important thing you get out, like what I thought was most important to doing well in the class was teamwork skills. What I think-- sorry. What I thought was most important to having a good time and not having like, like having a healthy and good time in the class was teamwork skills.

**AW:**         What I say is most important to getting an A in the class, is what you write in the write up and the actual content of the class, and the software, the code you write itself is almost irrelevant to either of those two things. Like those things should be aligned, right? Whatever the course is. And so if you decide that your goal is like teamwork, then like you write-- you write about that and be like you have to like delegate who writes code in a way that optimizes for teamwork and you like give challenging assignments that require like a lot of communication over like relatively complex pieces of code that aren&#39;t like crazy big. And that&#39;s how you get a class about like teamwork and software design. And if you do the same thing about like teaching people different paradigms, then you don&#39;t give them four projects and give them a dozen articles, blog posts a week and like lecture about these concepts. You actually lecture about concepts that are useful in your assessments and your projects. The consistency there is really important for me.

**Michelle Chen:**         I agree with you. What could the CS department do better? This is my last one. You can really say anything because I&#39;m basically just gonna slap these in a list and be like, here&#39;s things that I think that you guys could do better. Or do you have any qualms with the department and anything that you wish--

**AW:**         So I don&#39;t think I engage with the department specifically enough to learn about a lot of specific problems. I think a lot of people are frustrated that Duke CS is heavy on theory and light on like practical skills. I think that&#39;s true, but like we have Lynda and we have code academy and a lot of that stuff is really hard to teach in a classroom, so I don&#39;t blame them too much for it. I also understand that like professors do research and that&#39;s more interesting. I think the biggest qualm is I think we need--so if 101 and 201 are going to be our intro courses, they need to be taught by the same people every semester. Those same people need to spend a lot of time and have a lot of resources to creating a really good experience and that needs to be like the sole priority of the department until that&#39;s done.  Right. So I look at CS50 at Harvard and Yale. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re familiar with those--

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah yeah yeah.

**AW:**         Yeah, the ones you can find on youtube and I think like this, the importance of this is on so many levels. Um, or like the implementation, like where this needs to happen in so many levels, the importance of it is just: one, you give people a good foundation to like learn things from and two, you don&#39;t burn people out early on. And if I had to break it up, I would say it&#39;s in--the first area where this is important is like resource allocation. So like there needs to be enough cs 201 TAs where people don&#39;t feel like office hours are useless because of office hours are useless, then they feel hopeless and they just don&#39;t do it anymore. Right? Next, as far as curriculum design, like I think CS201 curriculum is taught in a different order every semester.  I think it&#39;s just kind of based on what people feel is the-- or whatever the three or four professors that teach it feels appropriate for that semester and I TA&#39;d for four, three, four semesters of CS201 and it was just like a complete nightmare each time because it was taught to complete differently you know, there were professors that were using um, trees in an assignment before they taught trees and expecting students to not have questions about that. And I think, I mean, you can kind of think of it as like dependency management, right? Let&#39;s minimize the number of dependencies, number of unlearned dependencies that people need at any time and their 201 process and maybe 101. I didn&#39;t take 101, so I don&#39;t know. Um, and I realize that is an incredibly hard problem, right? Like, it&#39;s, I mean like honestly you could probably do some graph theory to figure out what&#39;s the best way to minimize dependencies, right?

**AW:**         Like I think and, and, and, and, and, and, and you can only minimize dependencies to a certain point, but then I think the way to mitigate after that is understanding when a concept is like really hard to define because you haven&#39;t taught the dependencies yet. And then like really putting a lot of into how you can teach every basic concept so that they have just enough to understand or like, like let&#39;s say you&#39;re teaching about sets in Java but you haven&#39;t taught about--haven&#39;t talked about classes yet, right? Like one that&#39;s kind of dumb, two that&#39;s basically what happened in 201, and then three, I&#39;m not saying teach them about classes before you can teach them how to use the tree set class or whatever, but give them enough understanding of it so they can use tree sets. Actually sit down for like 20 minutes and think about like, OK, I&#39;ve never done Java before and my first day&#39;s lecture uses a tree set. Like how the hell am I gonna figure out what this thing is? What is the minimum amount of knowledge I need to understand that? And then package that in there and then go from there. And yes, that will result in like a little bit of redundancy and yes, that&#39;ll make, make things go slower, but like that&#39;s what your students deserve. Like otherwise it&#39;s just so... It&#39;s horrible. Um, and then on that note, just I think the idea that students were supposed to show up in 201 having had 101 experience and like understand Java, they&#39;re given no Java instruction like actual Java instruction and yes I understand that like the courses about concepts and Java syntax is like maybe below a professor or like not something that they should spend the time teaching, but like the amount of times I taught people like what a main method is and how to write a class... Like I think every single semester that TA&#39;d, like that was like my first lesson right. Where like I didn&#39;t really just like did not pay attention to what the professor had given me for the first, like four or five weeks because it was just useless because people had so many questions that I had by that time  figured out like a good four or five week curriculum of how to answer the questions that they&#39;re probably having this time of year and to do so. Right. And I don&#39;t know, like I, I still do like cs 201 review sessions before finals for like friends that I meet in like ASA or something. And like last semester I had to explain to someone what the difference between like private public and protected is, which is like, it&#39;s literally the first word you write when you code in Java and like how did people not know that? Like that kind of stuff.

**AW:**         And this is not like easy. I&#39;m not saying they should, that they should have done this all along. But like take your head out of the clouds, sit down with, with literally with students, or like put yourself in their shoes and think about what they do and don&#39;t know and redesign the curriculum so that people aren&#39;t left trying to, you know, like build some big concept off of really, really shaky foundations. Because otherwise you&#39;re just setting up people up for a bad time throughout the rest of their CS career. Um, or, or if it&#39;s the current intention to be a weed out, then keep it exactly the way it is because what CS201 does right now it weed outs anyone who does not find this stuff intuitive. Like maybe not that they won&#39;t, they don&#39;t fail, but I don&#39;t know. Like the amount of times I&#39;ve seen people like writing 10, four loops for an array--sorry, 10 like statements for an array that&#39;s 10, like that&#39;s 10 long. Right? Like, that&#39;s just like, if you don&#39;t get that intuitively, then you&#39;re not gonna understand that. And if Duke is saying compsci isn&#39;t right for you, then that&#39;s fine. I mean that&#39;s our way of like getting rid of those people. But if that&#39;s the case, 201 should be harder. But if it&#39;s not a weed out class, then you have to like take, I think. I think the biggest, the biggest directive I would give is... Imagine you&#39;re teaching this, imagine every concept is not intuitive to your student. How would you teach it? And go one by one like that?

**AW:**         Yeah. It was kind of a mess. I feel bad for everyone taking 201.

**Michelle Chen:**         I, you know, it&#39;s interesting because I feel like 201&#39;s not a weed out class. I feel like people are more discouraged by like 250, or at least I was because I after I took it, I was like I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing. That&#39;s interesting that you--I TA&#39;d 201 for one semester

**AW:**         Well I mean that logic applies, but like 201 is just earlier in the pipeline, right? So they can both be weedout classes.

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you have a lot of friends who ended up dropping?

**AW:**         No that&#39;s why I say that if it was actually a weed-out class, it doesn&#39;t do that good of a job of weeding people out, right? But like I guess the way that it has been constructed leads me to think it looks like a weed out class and they way both prevent it from being a weed out class and prevent it from being problematic for all those reasons is to think about redesigning the curriculum or evaluating each case on the curriculum as if the students were to find it extremely un-intuitive, and how would you teach it based on that? Right.

**Michelle Chen:**         Interesting.

**AW:**         And that does also mean like finding-- mean, and when I say get your head out of the clouds, I don&#39;t mean that in a derogatory way, but like if I code in Java, right, learning how to teach people who don&#39;t know Java, it&#39;s going to be really hard unless I either practice or go talk to someone who doesn&#39;t know, like, yeah, you have to go, you have to be around people that don&#39;t know Java to learn how to teach beginners Java.

**Michelle Chen:**         Thank you. Do you think there&#39;s anyone else that&#39;d be good to interview?  Um, or anyone you can think of? I&#39;m just trying to get a lot of experiences.

**AW:**         Jeremy Fox, he graduated last year.

**Michelle Chen:**         Oh, I know him.

**AW:**         He was in HackDuke for a while. almost wrote a book on like a medium guide, a guide to like dude comp sci. And then he ran out of time before he graduated. He has a lot of thoughts. And then Shelley probably just because like-- did you already talk to her?

**Michelle Chen:**         I have her.  Well I, I&#39;m going, I&#39;m going to interview her. Any, anything else you want to say?

**AW:**         I think it&#39;s great that you&#39;re doing this.

**Michelle Chen:**         Thank you. Also Astrachan&#39;s my professor so he&#39;ll be, he&#39;ll be the one reading. I don&#39;t know if that changes anything for you.

**AW:**         No, no. I&#39;ve never had Astrachan, um, I mean I don&#39;t want to be too harsh on the 201 professors because I, I, I&#39;ve only ever had the privilege of teaching like basically a dozen people that don&#39;t get it at a time and any like heuristics I have on how I can teach a dozen people, like with each additional person gets, gets exponentially more complicated. Right. So like, you know, I only see the bad, like I always have the people that doesn&#39;t work  for and that&#39;s my opinion is informed by that.

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you think that they&#39;re going to think that it&#39;s going to be too easy for some people if they change it? Too easy for the people at the top of the class.

**AW:**         Yeah. But that&#39;s, that&#39;s-- if they have a problem with that and they need to come to terms with what that means and like be OK with that in a teaching philosophy, right? And I guess that&#39;s what I mean, like I&#39;m not, I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t mean that in too like accusative of a way, but like it&#39;s like are you teaching for the bottom or the top? Are you trying to push the bottom up or push the top forward? Because a class like 201 I would argue is not there to push the top forward. Like that&#39;s for like, like if you want that to be the concern, let people skip 230 and go straight to 3:30. Right? Or something like that. Because I&#39;ve taken combinatorics and I can do like 9 choose 3 on a ti 84 calculator. So I don&#39;t need to be in you know, like CS230. I don&#39;t know.

**Michelle Chen:**         Thank you. I&#39;m gonna stop the recording.
