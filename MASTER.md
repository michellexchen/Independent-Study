<p>

**Michelle Chen:**         Ok, so I think I&#39;m recording. So, basically I have like two sets of questions that I&#39;m trying to combine, but it might just end up just as... I think that it honestly would be better just as like a conversation? So wherever it goes. So I guess the first question is, what year are you at Duke?

**PT:**         I&#39;m a junior.

**Michelle Chen:**         And did you have any computer science education prior to Duke?

**PT:**         Yeah, I did. Um, uh, my dad is a software engineer, so I kind of grew up like knowing about that world but also like I both like took and like taught computer science based classes at my high school. So yeah, I mean it wasn&#39;t like super extensive but then also the summer before I came to Duke I had a documentation internship at um, at uh, an IT automation company where I&#39;m from in Portland, so I did a lot of like software adjacent and stuff there and like was paid for it. So like I kind of had a sense of like, I guess my value as a worker coming into Duke.

**Michelle Chen:**         Did you take any like classes in high school?

**PT:**         Yeah, um only one. Oh my God, I had a python independent study that one, like, so badly because I was fucking around on Code Academy. But I also took a visual basic class my senior year. Um, actually that was a huge mess because my best friend sat next to me and he would always like copy off me, and I like didn&#39;t care because I would just do my own work and he would just look over and like copy off my screen--

**PT:**         Your code?

**PT:**         Yeah. And then we got like scare quotes, caught for scare quotes, plagiarizing and like I got in almost as much trouble as he did. I was like, this is such bullshit. Like he just looked at my screen but he totally took the fall and it was fine, like I mean it was whatever, but it like this whole thing, it was funny. But I also, like I taught a class on autonomous vehicles at my school and so we had to use Arduino, and Arduino is is like a C derivative.

**Michelle Chen:**         So I guess like what did the demographics of that [class] look like in high school? Like male, female wise.

**PT:**         Like all boys. My high school was really, really white. So like, like it was literally 97 percent white I think, um, maybe less. But it was also only 200 students. My high school was really white, but there would be like, like I remember in the um CS class that I like the, when I taught, but also in the one I took, like it would be mostly like white boys and then like um, a couple like women and like some women of color or like I think there was one.

**Michelle Chen:**         Ok. And at Duke, have you taken-- which of these have you taken? 308, 310, and 330.

**PT:**         I&#39;m in 310.

**Michelle Chen:**         And you haven&#39;t taken 308 or 330?

**PT:**         I&#39;m about to take 330.

**Michelle Chen:**         OK. So did your family or do your family and friends encourage you to study computer science?

**PT:**         Uh, yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         Like in what ways or if they do or they don&#39;t.

**PT:**         My like family is like, my dad is in computer science. I, it was always just there. I think for for him it&#39;s like a point of pride that I&#39;m studying this major that&#39;s so like quote unquote useful and like, you know, like of course that is a useful major. I think they wouldn&#39;t care what I did, but like you know, you can tell when your parents are like happy with you versus not happy with you, especially because I have, I do have what I consider like a pretty like impressive professional like resume if not academic at all, but like professionally, like I think they really appreciate that. Um, my friends are like girls like, you know, it&#39;s like girls in STEM. So like haha like. Also my best friend is a computer science major or so we like help each other out.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. Well I guess that leads to my next question which is: who you surround yourself in classes, group work, research experiences, and other aspects of compsci learning?

**PT:**         Like only women. Like I don&#39;t really have boy, like male friends anyway that much. Especially not straight men. I&#39;m just not friends with them but like a lot, a lot of like computer science girls as much as possible but also like in my selective living group I guess just like it&#39;s, it&#39;s random. It&#39;s not necessarily computer science. My closest friend is a computer science major and like a lot of my other friends that I like love and look up to like you like computer science,

**Michelle Chen:**         So I guess, like why do you think you chose those individuals to surround yourself with?

**PT:**         I mean my best friend and I met in compsci 201 [laughs], so that&#39;s why we&#39;re friends. I spent like a year and a half in Pratt so um, that&#39;s where I met like, like it&#39;s freshman year and second year, first semester sophomore year I spent in Pratt, so like that&#39;s who I would spend the most time with. Um, my ex boyfriend is in Pratt so like I would spend time with him and then like in my selective living group, like in Mirecourt we would like-- if I need help with an assignment I&#39;ll talk to the computer science kids and stuff like that. But like other than that, I&#39;ll just be friends with the kids on my selective living groups. So it&#39;s not necessarily like sectioned by major.

**Michelle Chen:**         So you don&#39;t think it&#39;s intentional that you like, especially in comp sci, like to try to surround yourself with women or like not straight men?

**PT:**         No, I just don&#39;t like having male friends.

**Michelle Chen:**         In general, not just in CS?

**PT:**         Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         That&#39;s fair. Me either. All my friends are girls or gay. And then I guess, so then do you think your experience in compsci has been different than most male experiences--

**PT:**         Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         And if so, how?

**PT:**         Wow. I just really said knee jerk, yeah. But like, oh my God. Like I just remember me and my best friend Jasmine, like coming across this realization that it&#39;s OK to be like average, you know. Which like, I don&#39;t think any dude has ever had to be like, &quot;hey, it&#39;s OK to be average&quot;, because like, first of all they&#39;re all already so fucking average.They&#39;re like &quot;I&#39;m so great&quot; and I&#39;m like, &quot;shut up&quot;.  Um, so like there&#39;s that, but then just like, I don&#39;t know, I think it&#39;s a very different experience in office hours, like dudes being really unafraid to like put themselves fucking first on the list or like ask really stupid questions. Like I feel so scared asking a really stupid question and then this guy will be like, &quot;how do I set up my git repo&quot;? And I&#39;m like, &quot;are you kidding me? You&#39;re really wasting all of our time with that.&quot; I would NEVER ask that. Ever. I&#39;d be so embarrassed. Um, yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         I mean, I guess on that, I feel the same way. Do you think like, why do you think that? That&#39;s something I&#39;ve never understood.

**PT:**         Because. Because I think because If I ask something like &quot;um, how do I set up my git repo?&quot;, like something that, like they&#39;re going to be like &quot;This stupid fucking girl. Like why is she here? Just like fucking look it up. Stupid girl&quot;, you know? But like a dude does that all the time and like maybe people like kind of roll their eyes but like no one&#39;s like &quot;this stupid fucking, this stupid boy&quot;.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. And do you think that&#39;s like magnified in compsci though?

**PT:**         Yeah, I haven&#39;t really noticed anywhere else, I guess.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, I mean that&#39;s how I feel to. In some of my experiences, like people literally are like &quot;you&#39;re a stupid fucking girl&quot; and they like delete my code, but if a guy does that, it&#39;s just like, oh, he just didn&#39;t like, you know?

**PT:**         Yeah. Otherwise it&#39;s like, I&#39;ll get like, like I had a TA sit with me for literally like an hour and a half in office hours and some other guy was like, &quot;hey man, can we, um, move the TAs around?&quot; Because that&#39;s a fair question, I agree. And the TA was just like, you know what, I&#39;m going to finish up helping her, and then I&#39;ll continue on. And I was like, [laughs] you&#39;ve spent so much time with me, like why is that?

**Michelle Chen:**         Wait like why do you think that was?

**PT:**         I talked to my friend about it or like my friend who&#39;s a guy who&#39;s also a TA for that class. And I was like, &quot;oh my God, X TA spent like an hour and a half with me I couldn&#39;t believe it&quot;. I was like, &quot;why did he do that&quot;? And he was like, &quot;oh, probably because you&#39;re pretty and a girl&quot;.

**Michelle Chen:**         Oh, interesting. So, but do you think that is helpful? You know, like, or do you think it&#39;s like, like is it something you like?

**PT:**         You know, like if someone&#39;s going to give me extra help for something I can&#39;t control then like fuck it, give me that. You know? Like I don&#39;t care.

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you think was, do you think, do you feel like it was like the situation in 250 where he was expecting--the TA was expecting something to come out of it?

**PT:**         No, because like I also like know the TA, like, like we were like relative, I mean we&#39;re not friends, but I&#39;ve had conversations, and like talked to him and seen him outside of a CS context.

**Michelle Chen:**         That&#39;s fair. OK. So let me see. Um, in what ways is your gender impacted your experiences as a computer science major in classes, or research, or any other CS environment?

**PT:**         I don&#39;t know. I think we&#39;ve just talked about that.

**Michelle Chen:**         OK, yeah, that&#39;s fair. Like beyond classes or office hours do you feel like you&#39;ve seen it anywhere else in compsci?

**PT:**         I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t affiliate myself that much with like CS communities. I used to be on the exec team for hockey, which I left but like I also like that&#39;s not, that&#39;s a programming as in like it&#39;s an events programming committee rather than like an actual, like computer science thing. And like I had ACM but like I just don&#39;t do anything so it doesn&#39;t matter.

Speaker 4:        What about group projects? Have you taken group project based classes?

**PT:**         Yeah like I deliberately choose to work with my friends and then like my friends were mostly women so I&#39;ll have at least one person like on my side. We have like, like in the current, like 310 group, our  third partner who&#39;s a dude, he&#39;s bad at communicating and he&#39;s like, he just ends up doing all the work because he doesn&#39;t communicate to us what we need, but like honestly I don&#39;t care. I&#39;m like, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a gender based. I just think it&#39;s a dude who&#39;s bad at communicating.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, that&#39;s fair. And then do you feel like it&#39;s better to work with only women or like work with other women in cs? Because like honestly I&#39;m asking that just because

**PT:**         I would only ever want to have at least one on my side. Like me working in a group with only boys sounds like hell to me. I just would not do it.

**Michelle Chen:**         That&#39;s like been some of my--that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking because like I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve just been looking back on my experiences and I feel like that&#39;s been some of my...

**PT:**         I would never do it.

**Michelle Chen:**         But some of it&#39;s like, mandatory. Like 308, it was mandatory that I was with a group of four guys and it was, it was terrible. Like there, you&#39;re right, there&#39;s no one on your side, you feel like the stupid girl who can&#39;t ask any questions and then like, I don&#39;t know.

**PT:**         And there&#39;s this like, like dudes love to like pretend. Oh my God, I just remember this one dude who like, he&#39;s ECE/CS so like I had a ton of like CS classes and ECE classes with him when I was still ECE and he was always like pretending like he worked so hard and like literally I had like ECE 110 with him and we like weren&#39;t in the same like you have to like build a robot in a group of two. And I was like, with this kid who like I loved having as a partner, he was like funny and we got along really well. But this other--like, like I felt like I knew what I was doing, I&#39;m like, it was Arduino, so like I had literally had like two to three years of experience with that already. Like I knew what it was up. And like the kid who was my partner, like we worked really well together and like he was able to be like, &quot;yeah, let&#39;s go&quot;. Like it was good. And this kid would come up to us, and be like, &quot;hi, do you need any help?&quot; And we would be like &quot;what?&quot;, and he&#39;d be like, &quot;do you need help with yours?&quot; and we were like, &quot;no, we finished&quot;. And he&#39;d be like really, really surprised and then wander off and they would like come to show that like he didn&#39;t know, like his group was like failing. And then there was like another one.

**Michelle Chen:**         So he asked you if you needed help during this class?

**PT:**         Yes. And then he and then he like his group, like their robot didn&#39;t work. And then there was like another time in the same class where like I was asking the TA to like make a certain part of our project easier. I was like, &quot;oh, can we start on this ramp and then program it to go like basically backwards through this circuit instead of like starting on the circuit and then going up the ramp?&quot;, which is much more difficult to do. I mean I&#39;m like fucking like explaining this so poorly. But whatever. Like basically the Ta was like, &quot;haha, yeah, you can do this&quot;. And I remember complaining and being like, &quot;Ugh, I already coded it the other way, but like, sure I&#39;ll do it&quot;. And this kid, this dude, wanders up and--

**Michelle Chen:**         The same one?

**PT:**         No, different guy. Different guy wanders up and like he&#39;s been like listening and he&#39;s like, &quot;OK, so what you&#39;re going to do is this&quot; and re-explained what the TA had just said to me. And I just stared at him and I was like, &quot;thanks&quot;  and like walked away. I was like, but like me and my partner just laughed about hysterically because we&#39;re like, I can&#39;t believe that just happened. Like and he was speaking just to me. He was like, &quot;what you&#39;re going to do is this.&quot; And literally repeated exactly what the guy said.

**Michelle Chen:**         Did you make eye contact with him? Like why--

**PT:**         He was just standing off to the side.

**Michelle Chen:**         Did you ask, like did you motioned to him at all?

**PT:**         No! [laughs]

**Michelle Chen:**         So he&#39;s literally just came up to you and..

**PT:**         Yes! It was, it was so wack.

**Michelle Chen:**         I&#39;m not surprised. I&#39;m more just like, of course happened to you.

**PT:**         There was one time in EGR 103, when um, I would like with some of the boys in my hall be in the common room during like the Matlab programming and at one point, um, one of the boys was like, &quot;hey pat, did you get this? Like, did you get the question?&quot; I was like, &quot;yeah, I did here you go&quot;, and like passed my computer over to him so he could like, look at what-- I mean, it was fucking 103. Like, is this against the honor code? Yes. I like explained to him my code or my computer was directly in front of him and another kid comes in and he goes, &quot;Oh my God, Patricia, Jack is doing your work for you? Like Jack&#39;s literally typing your code for you&quot;. And I was like, &quot;...he&#39;s copying my code&quot;. The rest of the boys in the room were actually like &quot;boo dude. What the fuck?&quot; Like they like made fun of him, but it just because it was so blatant. But he liked scampered and he liked scampered out the room, but I was just like &quot;are you kidding me?&quot; You think this kid is literally typing code for me? Also like he wasn&#39;t even on my computer. Like he was looking at my computer and typing on his own. And this kid&#39;s like automatic assumption is that he&#39;s doing my assignment for me. Which is insane!

**Michelle Chen:**         Did you know the kid?

**PT:**         Yeah, we were like friends, not the kid I was helping, but the kid who like walked in, he was just being an asshole.  Isn&#39;t that funny?

**Michelle Chen:**         That&#39;s, I mean, yes, funny is a word for it. I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m just like, part of the reason I&#39;m doing this project is because I&#39;m like looking back and I&#39;m just like, there have been things that I&#39;ve laughed about and like shrugged off that honestly, like were pretty fucked up and like really not cool. And like, I don&#39;t know.

**PT:**         I mean, there&#39;s already so much of CS that&#39;s like intensely depressing and unfair. And as I&#39;m like a wealthy white woman with like the most connections in computer science you could ever have, um, so like I&#39;m not going to like take my own experience and be like, ah, you know? It&#39;s been like, because like there&#39;s bigger fish to fry for me.

**Michelle Chen:**         My next question is how do you think your race or race in general, socioeconomic status and other identity factors impacts computer science experiences for people at Duke?

**PT:**         Um, it&#39;s hard for me to even speak for any speak to anyone else&#39;s experience is because mine is so unique. Um, like academically I&#39;m not talented. I think, like I&#39;m just not good at school. That kind of goes like I&#39;m just, I&#39;m just not. Like my at Duke, my focus hasn&#39;t really been academics, and that&#39;s something that I&#39;m fine with whatever. Professionally I&#39;m like-- I&#39;m chewing sorry-- like I don&#39;t think there like an easier higher for interns in the world than me. Like I literally, like the way I got my current internship is like the CEO reached out to me on twitter and was like, &quot;hey are you looking for an internship&quot;? Because I met him out like an open source conference that my dad was invited to like four years ago or like maybe even six years ago.

**Michelle Chen:**         So you feel like it&#39;s hard for you to be like--

**PT:**         I can&#39;t really speak to anyone else but me.

**Michelle Chen:**         Cause you don&#39;t want to be like &quot;woe is me&quot;.

**PT:**         Yeah, cause woe isn&#39;t me. I&#39;m chilling. Like my grades are terrible to be honest and I got really good job offers anyway. So, and like that&#39;s all because of my identity factors. like for me now, even in terms of hiring, like I think being a woman has even helped me because like I&#39;m such an easy like diversity hire that also happens to have a bunch of other like weird assets.

**Michelle Chen:**         Which by the way, why are you recruiting again?

**PT:**         I was going to work in Durham with Colin. I mean, not with Colin, but the reason I was in the area with because of Colin and so I don&#39;t want to be in Durham, if I don&#39;t have to be.  I&#39;m working on a startup in New York.

**Michelle Chen:**         Wait I start June 14th like literally so early. OK like let&#39;s hang out actually.

**PT:**         Mhm. I&#39;m working on the Flatiron district and I&#39;m living in the East village.

**Michelle Chen:**         East village? Oh, that&#39;s a cool place to live.

**PT:**         Yeah I&#39;m excited. I&#39;m subletting from my friend.

**Michelle Chen:**         Wow. Interesting. So you don&#39;t necessarily feel like your like gender, race, gender, socioeconomic has impacted your experiences here? But it definitely does for some people in compsci.

**PT:**         Yeah. I just don&#39;t want to speak to it.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, that&#39;s fair. Um, OK. Let&#39;s see. Do you feel as if there&#39;s a community in which you&#39;re welcome in the Duke CS Department.

**PT:**         No. [Laughs]

**Michelle Chen:**         I love these answers where you&#39;re very like, yes. No, no.

**PT:**         Not at all. I don&#39;t even know what that would look like. I mean the thing is like, like I lead ACM and I choose not to do anything with that because I don&#39;t care. Um, I was on HackDuke, I really don&#39;t feel welcome in the community anymore. It&#39;s something I actively make fun of. Stephanie&#39;s going to Goldman.

**Michelle Chen:**         Really? I haven&#39;t been to a meeting this whole year. Yeah, this whole year.

**PT:**         Well, social good is fucked, right? We&#39;ll both be in New York, I&#39;ll spit on her street if I see her. She&#39;s working for their UX division. I&#39;m like, what UX? She&#39;s cracked as fuck. Anyway, sorry if this interview going to be garbage.

**Michelle Chen:**         No, I&#39;m glad that you were my first because I feel like you&#39;re one of the people who&#39;s OK with me not having this all together.

**PT:**         Well God forbid if you did.

**Michelle Chen:**         OK so you don&#39;t feel like there&#39;s a community in which you&#39;re welcome.

**PT:**         No, but I haven&#39;t like sought one out you know, I don&#39;t like, why would I want to be part of the Duke CS community? Like, it&#39;s all assholes and centrists.

**Michelle Chen:**         Like what--what makes you say that?

**PT:**         Like it&#39;s all either boys who I hate and don&#39;t want to spend time with, or it&#39;s like centrist women who are like, women who code. I&#39;m like OK, whatever,  you know? Like good for you. Kappa Kappa Gamma. Like, cool, you know.

**Michelle Chen:**         Interesting. So do you like--you just feel like the space is full of people that you don&#39;t like?

**PT:**         I think my computer science like goals or whatever or you know, are much more like political.

**Michelle Chen:**         \*drops phone\* Sorry to my transcription.

**PT:**         Um, I think my goals are much more political and I don&#39;t really-- like there&#39;s a couple of people, like individuals who I&#39;ve been very impressed and have like really given me access to some really cool resources. Um, but like as a community, like absolutely not. But that&#39;s all of Duke, you know, like no one to Duke is like particularly like, I mean when I say no one, I don&#39;t mean no one. I think there&#39;s like really great activists at Duke but like the vast majority of Duke is like super centrist and like politically very uninspiring. Like when I think about community, I don&#39;t give a fuck if we have like weekly like Wiring with Women meetings, that&#39;s not what I need. But like instead to have like a radical left computer science community, that would be more interesting to me. But like that&#39;s never going to happen with Duke.

**Michelle Chen:**         Are there places with a radical left?

**PT:**         Yeah, there&#39;s some cool like online communities like um, Tech Solidarity, which is this like um, group that this um, programmer Maciej Ceglowski founded who I really admire but like they like do like political funding for um, like leftist, like non partisan--not non-partisan but non-mainstream leftist candidates which is really cool. And they also are like are pushing for a tech workers union, which is not to like increase funding but rather like a tech workers union that would like give more power to tech workers whose companies like are doing like wildly unfair things, you know, like when Palantir does like predictive policing. If the workers, their workers there have a union then like they can speak out against that.

**Michelle Chen:**         Interesting.

**PT:**         Yeah. Yeah. But that&#39;s the sort of like labor power that Duke students also don&#39;t necessarily have, but like at the same time like, you know, like there&#39;s no one, I don&#39;t know, but like blah blah blah. Yeah. Like I think there&#39;s many reasons that that couldn&#39;t happen at Duke. And I think some of-- like half of them are like Duke students fault, half of them are just like whatever it&#39;s a school, you know, it&#39;s not like we&#39;re doing like labor really. Like it&#39;s not like there&#39;s anything we need to be like fucking unionizing over because we&#39;re undergrads, but like, you know what I mean.

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you think though that there&#39;s something that you need or you want from this community? Like, or are you just like, do you feel like you just don&#39;t want to be a part of them because you don&#39;t need them or do you feel like they could be helpful in some ways, but they&#39;re just not there?

**PT:**         I don&#39;t need them.  Like that&#39;s saying I specifically don&#39;t need them because I don&#39;t need like a &quot;girl gang&quot; quote unquote. And I don&#39;t need networking opportunities. Like if someone else wants that, I&#39;m definitely not like  begrudging them that. And I know that that can be really empowering. It&#39;s just not something I need or want for myself. Like it&#39;s, it&#39;s maybe selfish and it&#39;s maybe just me being realistic.

**Michelle Chen:**         Um, let&#39;s see.  Well I guess. OK. So I do want to ask you specifically, so you&#39;re in 310 now right?

**PT:**         Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         So I want to know about your experiences in that class as a whole. Like when I say 310, like positive, negative, like what? Like what&#39;s your knee jerk reaction? Like?

**PT:**         Um, honestly, like our--this is so bad. I like feel awkward saying this in the interview and having it like be public record or whatever.

**Michelle Chen:**         I can cut it out.

**PT:**         No, no it&#39;s fine. It&#39;s fine. I&#39;m just speaks to like, my lack of academic, like talent. Our like third group member has been doing like so much of the projects for us because he just doesn&#39;t care and he just wants to like bang it out and we&#39;re like, we don&#39;t care enough to be like, &quot;no, let us learn&quot;, you know, like we&#39;re like OK, go, go off I guess. Um, the like it&#39;s called-- ugh God I&#39;m like outing myself in this interview. Um, there&#39;s no way you can put this in and keep me anonymous. It&#39;s called operating systems. So whenever I don&#39;t go to lectures anymore, which is just, I mean, that&#39;s not because of like anything except for--

**Michelle Chen:**         Who&#39;s your professor?

**PT:**         Chase, but like the, like first few lectures, like when he would say like Linux, like people would like look over me and I&#39;d be like, &quot;Hey&quot;, like, &quot;what&#39;s up&quot;, you know, like it didn&#39;t happen that much but like it happened, you know, like sometimes it just happens.

**PT:**         Um, and then like the first, maybe the first week I emailed the professor Chase because I was like, like &quot;can I use my own unix environment? I&#39;ve been using Linux and like I want to use my, like, like I want to use Fedora instead of um Ubuntu&quot;, which is what the class uses. And like I was just wondering if that&#39;s going to work. Like I was, like, of course it will, but like a TA told me it wouldn&#39;t so I just wanted to ask, you know, I was stuntin&#39; a little, um, and he responded back. He was like, &quot;Patricia warm, welcome to the class. Of course I know who you are, but I won&#39;t be mentioning it in class to the rest of the people&quot;. And I was like, thank you so much. Not like I appreciate that discretion and not every student would be as tactful as you, you know?

**PT:**         And then I like went to his office hours to ask him a question about like my code or something and they like, the rest of the kids had been like, waiting out-- this is such a whack story, but it&#39;s kind of funny. Um, the rest of the kids who had been waiting for him were like waiting outside and that like LSRC breakout area and I like rounded the corner and like just opened the door where he was and he was finishing up an email or something like someone else must have come in. And he was like, &quot;give me a second&quot;. And so they were waiting outside and I like rounded the door and opened the door and he was like, &quot;oh, hello!&quot;. And I was like, &quot;hi, how are you&quot;? And he was like, &quot;give me one second&quot;. And then he like immediately, like took, like he closed his computer or whatever and like walked out with me to like break out area. He was looking around. He was like, &quot;uh, yeah, I&#39;m just gonna meet with her real quick and then I&#39;ll come back for the rest of you&quot; even though I clearly just got in there like someone else must have done. It&#39;s like, OK, um, we like went into his office and he was like, &quot;hi, so you&#39;re Patricia&quot;. And I was like, &quot;yes, I am&quot;, you know, I was like, &quot;hey.&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;oh, it&#39;s so good to meet you&quot;. And I was like, &quot;you too&quot;. I mean, he was like, &quot;so what&#39;s the problem&quot;? I was like, &quot;I don&#39;t know, I think I&#39;m just like, fucking like pulling my repository wrong&quot;. I was. Like, it was a fucking git problem it&#39;s embarrassing. And he was like, &quot;just give me your group number and I&#39;ll look over it personally&quot;. And I was like, &quot;OK&quot;, and I like scampered off.

**PT:**         Which like I literally talked to my friend who like does an independent study for him and he was like, that&#39;s weird that he did that for you. I was like, is it? And he was just like, yeah, he couldn&#39;t do that. And I was like, OK, you know. So that was like the first week of class and since then I know that I&#39;ve only let him down with my poor performance in this class and on the mid-terms, so ah, if he&#39;s going to have unrealistic standards for me, I&#39;m just gonna I&#39;m just not going to meet them, you know, and that&#39;s kind of been the vibe there. But yeah, that kind of thing happens sometimes and it&#39;s like,

**Michelle Chen:**         How does it make you feel? I guess I didn&#39;t realize that. Like I forgot. Yeah, that this is a perspective that you could provide because I was thinking more like people in compsci who are just girls.

**PT:**         Sorry, I&#39;m like fucking up your study because this is like a unique perspective.

**Michelle Chen:**         No, I appreciate it.

**PT:**         Um, sometimes you know, like sometimes I just roll with it. I&#39;m like, this is like, I recognize that it&#39;s like, it always benefits me and like it&#39;s like professors giving you personal time and like, you know, stuff like that. Like, like sometimes it hurts my feelings because I&#39;m like, oh, like I&#39;m not gonna live up to your goals. Like, you know, like that suck, you&#39;re setting an expectation for me that I definitely can&#39;t meet. It sometimes makes me feel like embarrassed. Like when Astrachan in our class would be like &quot;Linux&quot; or like, you know, that one time when I was like, &quot;no, this is how it is&quot;. And he&#39;s like, &quot;heheh, I guess you would know&quot;. And I was like [sighs]. Yeah, I didn&#39;t write it, honey, you know, it&#39;s like sometimes a mixed bag of emotions. I like also like I&#39;m really, really proud of what my dad&#39;s accomplished because like I think it&#39;s really amazing and that kind of only becomes more clear as time goes on. That like, holy shit, this is actually really amazing. But like, yeah, it&#39;s just like kind of where we&#39;re at.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, I can see that. That&#39;s. Hm. Do you feel like it&#39;s like a lot of. So you feel like it&#39;s pressure to. Do you feel like he puts like your parents put pressure on, you?

**PT:**         No, my parents like they&#39;re chillin.

**Michelle Chen:**         That&#39;s interesting.

**PT:**         My parents really don&#39;t care. Um yeah I love my parents and how they act about it, which is to say they don&#39;t care and they&#39;re completely normal. Um, uh, what was the question? Like how I feel about it?

**Michelle Chen:**         But I have more, other questions. OK, this is an interesting question that is kind of off topic, but I wrote down: how does, does gender influence how you see your teammates? Because I know you said you like surround yourself with girls, but is there-- like when you see a guy that you don&#39;t know in comp psy, like are you automatically just like, like how&#39;d you find this other guy for your group?

**PT:**         On Piazza. Isn&#39;t that crazy? We found him on piazza because he like just really needed a third because he dropped the group size. Like, oh my god, I&#39;ve never like, our guy is like really good at compsci. Like he does those projects so well, but he&#39;s so bad at communicating and he&#39;s like, like oftentimes like, so... Like faith my other like the girl in my group, um, will like fight him on certain, like coding conventions or certain ways she wants to complete the project. And he&#39;ll be like, no, no, no, and like kinda shut her down. Which like I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s gendered or if it&#39;s just him wanting to do his own thing, you know, like, just because he&#39;s done like so much of the project. Um like, I don&#39;t wanna like ascribe it to gender. Although what can&#39;t be ascribed gender, I don&#39;t know. But like, you know, there was a time where I would like a boy would say something about like cs and I&#39;d be like, oh damn, like he&#39;s probably right. Lately I&#39;ve been like, damn ya&#39;ll are so stupid. Like you don&#39;t know shit, like you don&#39;t know, like fucking Dhruv or whatever will tweet something about like a coding language, and like I think like maybe a year ago I would have been like, I&#39;m so stupid. I&#39;m like, Dhruv, like knows what&#39;s up. Like now I&#39;m like damn, you&#39;re stupid as fuck.

**Michelle Chen:**         Really? That&#39;s interesting. I want to get there.

**PT:**         Like I think like--or like these-- oh my God, Faith and I were studying for the last 310  midterm with these two boys that Faith is close to and one of them is always fucking stepping on my lines. You know, I&#39;ll be like, like some, his friend will be like, can you explain to me how sudo works I have been using Linux my literally entire life. Like my actual entire life. And he&#39;ll be like, &quot;yeah um&quot;, I&#39;ll be like, &quot;yeah, so sudo is&quot; and he&#39;ll jump on my line and be like, &quot;uh it&#39;s a file, which like you change permissions&quot; and I&#39;m like where are you going with this? You&#39;re stupid and you&#39;re also wrong so I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re like, I&#39;m like go ahead and get the wrong answer or like whatever. But like you&#39;re really trying to stunt and you&#39;re shit at this. Like I&#39;ve become very comfortable. I think my role as a junior developer, like as I was interviewing and stuff, I&#39;d be like, &quot;I don&#39;t really know how to do this&quot; during the interview. And they&#39;d be like, &quot;hey, just just look it up&quot;. And I&#39;d be like, you know what? Yeah, I&#39;m a junior developer. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing. And they&#39;d be like, &quot;OK, yeah, sure&quot;. And like kind of like walk me through a little more. But it&#39;s like you know who you&#39;re hiring like you didn&#39;t like, you&#39;re not looking to hire me because like you think I&#39;m not going to act like an intern. You think I&#39;m gonna act like a senior developer.  You&#39;re hiring an intern who&#39;s still in college like so like we&#39;re all kind of stupid and like men especially are so stupid.

**Michelle Chen:**         Like, I mean this is not for the interview, this is just for me, but like how did you, like, how do you get there?

**PT:**         I guess I become like a lot more confident in my professional abilities because I&#39;m like

**Michelle Chen:**         Is it because of your work experiences?

**PT:**         Yeah. Because I&#39;m like three internships deep. And like I also like I know like I don&#39;t have a lot of skills but like some skills I have and like, like you know, I can just like feel comfortable in knowing what I know and also knowing that other people like just love to like stunt. And like if you dig a little deeper into what they think they know, like if you just ask them a few more questions, like, &quot;oh, like what do you mean by that&quot;? Or like, &quot;oh, can you just explain that a little more&quot;? They&#39;re gonna like trip over themselves and get confused because they don&#39;t actually know. It&#39;s like such a surface level understanding.

**Michelle Chen:**         Like I&#39;m like, what did Dhruv say?

**PT:**         Like he tweeted this stupid thing late like it was yesterday and he was, it was like he quote tweeted, oh my phone died. He quote tweeted, like, like, so the original tweet was like software, Stockholm Syndrome. Like when a technology is too bad, like when a technology, when you keep using a technology even when it&#39;s really bad because like you&#39;ve, you&#39;ve taken so much time to learn it and then he quote tweeted it, which means like--is this for the interview?

**Michelle Chen:**         I just want to know.

**PT:**         Like he, like, he like quoted saying like &quot;all of software and Javascript&quot;, which first of all is stupid because like the Venn diagram of like all of software--and javascript is inside that, like it&#39;s not an and it&#39;s like all software, comma, especially Javascript, I don&#39;t know.  But I like responded to it and I was like I disagree because Javascript is both easy to learn--so like directly contrary to this original tweet, and also my favorite language. Like I love Javascript.

**Michelle Chen:**         Did he respond?

**PT:**         Like no, but we talked about it in person. He was like, he was like, &quot;wait Pat, you like Javascript?&quot; I was like, &quot;yeah, I used it for all my technical interviews. I love javascript&quot; Also, it&#39;s easy to learn so it doesn&#39;t make any sense with the original tweet. And he was like, &quot;uh, yeah, I mean I guess I just like, like, you know, I like, like lower level languages&quot; which is classic boy phrase which just means &quot;I&#39;m smart&quot;, like he&#39;s like &quot;I like lower level language cause like C, I mean I guess C isn&#39;t easy to learn or easy to read. But like, I don&#39;t know, I guess it just makes more sense to me&quot; and like, you know,

**Michelle Chen:**         [laughs] so he likes MIPS

**PT:**         Like yeah, yeah, I was like you like MIPS dude?

**PT:**         I was like, you know, like Java scripts are just so extensible and like you get to learn some of the other languages. It was like, oh, I&#39;ve worked so much in node and angular too because of javascript. So like, I don&#39;t know, I guess I just really like it and appreciate it and I also don&#39;t think it&#39;s bad and he was like, &quot;well I don&#39;t know, just different for everyone&quot;. And I was like, fair enough dude, like, but it&#39;s like it&#39;s this little house of cards where like they say or tweet or present themselves in such a way to make themselves seem smart--Dhruv is actually a perfect example. But like if you just like, like you blow in this little house of cards and it&#39;s just like there&#39;s nothing there.

**Michelle Chen:**         So I watched you. I saw you respond to one of his tweets too.

**PT:**         Oh my God. He tweeted about like, oh my  brand is dog memes and Marxism. And I was like never seen you engage in Marxism bro but go off, I guess. Brand yourself.

**Michelle Chen:**         Did he respond to that?

**PT:**         No, he never talked to me. Oh, I tried to talk to him about it but he was really high so he didn&#39;t like react to me. But I was like, you don&#39;t interact with Marxism, nor do you interact with marxist. Like I&#39;m out here in a cultural studies class, like actually thinking and you&#39;re like sitting in your weed cloud like being fucking idiot and like being like ha haha, communism. And I&#39;m like, you&#39;re so stupid. Yeah. I don&#39;t know, like  it&#39;s just this, it&#39;s, it&#39;s become so easy to just like tiny bit like poke at these boys&#39; knowledge and see that there&#39;s nothing underneath.

**Michelle Chen:**         But they present themselves in different ways.

**PT:**         Yeah. That makes you think they do.

**Michelle Chen:**         Maybe it&#39;s because I don&#39;t have enough confidence because I&#39;m thinking about like all my classes where like literally I&#39;ve been explained like this is how it is and this is how it works and you&#39;re just dumb. And then I&#39;m like, yeah, you&#39;re right. Like I&#39;m stupid and I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing.

**PT:**         Yeah I feel really unconfident sometimes too. But like whenever I can like poke at that, like if I even have like that same level of surface level knowledge, like just do it and you&#39;ll see their heads explode.

**Michelle Chen:**         What about, so what is it like, do you feel like this in your internships, like how do they feel different than compsci at Duke?

**PT:**         Yeah, I love my internships.

**Michelle Chen:**         So then like, what&#39;s, what&#39;s different,

**PT:**         My like in my internships, first of all there&#39;s like a sense of fucking professional courtesy, which you don&#39;t get at Duke--

**Michelle Chen:**         But do you actually get that in internship, where people respect your work and

**PT:**         Yes! Well, like, OK, so like my two internships experiences that are actually like aggressively software as opposed to like technical documentation, which is a little different. Like the first one, there were three other interns, um, and a manager like a dedicated manager and then the last one, last summer it was a startup so it was tiny and it was all like, just like older people. But it wasn&#39;t like, it wasn&#39;t a very young startup, you know, like people there were like, like 27 to 30 something, you know, because it was like a medical startup. So they like, like a lot of them were like registered, like pharmacists or like everything else. And then like the engineering team was just a little bit older for it. Um, and in like the um, the one with the other interns like, you know, we&#39;re still like all students we&#39;re still like relatively peers and at one point like the boy, I mean it was a team of three girls and a boy, so I got lucky but they also did that on purpose because it was like they did it as like a professional choice.

**PT:**         But like at one point the boy said something-- like he just used the word like bitch off handedly, but the manager-- like it wasn&#39;t like directed towards any of us, he was like, &quot;oh that&#39;s such a bitch&quot; about something. And like none of us like reacted to it I think. But the manager ended up taking him aside later and being like, &quot;yo, don&#39;t say that&quot;. But also like just the sense of like knowing and being comfortable in the fact that like I&#39;m a junior developer, I&#39;m like a learning person. I got taken on in order to learn and to like bring value to the team in that sense. And not in necessarily a technical skill sense has helped me so much because it makes me feel like, OK, like these people aren&#39;t stupid. They hired me despite knowing that like I&#39;m not going to provide the same value to the team as a full-time engineer because I&#39;m not that and I&#39;m not at that level.

**PT:**         So like being like knowing that fact has helped me so much because it like they hire me because they want low level tasks done because they shouldn&#39;t have senior engineers working on like small fixes that like do improve the service but like waste people&#39;s time if they have like actual, like service architecture to work on, but also to like improve their own mentoring skills which is actually a valuable professional skill to like improve their company&#39;s PR because now they have an intern who&#39;s like out there at a college campus which is a really good recruiting ground. Like bring back full time, which is also really, really valuable. Like all of these things which aren&#39;t necessarily like hard skills that like the company doesn&#39;t need because if they did need it they would hire someone full time.

**Michelle Chen:**         So, I guess like, that&#39;s... Here&#39;s what I was thinking when you were saying that--like you know, how you were talking about like a lot of CS at Duke was like asshole guys, which I totally agree with, but thinking in, sorry, like this is a very disjointed train of thought--in thinking about this project where the guy for 308 appointed himself as like the PM, the project manager in a group of five guys and deleted--he forced to push over my code and like delete my code off like and just like telling me I didn&#39;t know what I was doing and stupid. And like once I was, I told him--have I told you this? I asked him a question. He was like, I just want you to know like you&#39;re a huge waste of my time right now. Like I can&#39;t believe. Like. And he was like, like I know what good design is.  You have no idea. Like it was just like. And now he&#39;s working at Linkedin. OK. And I get that like those are not necessarily

**PT:**         Yeah, but Linkedin is a garbage company.

**Michelle Chen:**         But here&#39;s. But here&#39;s the thing, like these people, these asshole guys are leaving and going into these--that&#39;s the reason why I didn&#39;t want to go into software because--and I get that every tech company is different you can find spaces but does it not bother you that like with every graduating class there&#39;s like the cohort of asshole tech guys going into their asshole tech roles and their hoodies and like they like, you know, like people that we&#39;ve met, like I&#39;m not saying everyone at Interact is like this, but there are people there like that and I was like, like I don&#39;t want it to be.

**PT:**         Yes, I know. And that&#39;s when you see those stories about like, like, like Uber and everywhere else that like it is real Github also. Like that&#39;s where I worked where I had a good experience but like that provides really, really bad experiences for other people. And I know I like, I know, but at the same time like, like there is still a pointed disconnect between a professional experience in which you have like a hierarchical structure. HR, like you know, like at the same time like this kid at Linkedin, like if he&#39;s a product manager or if he&#39;s an engineer, he&#39;s a junior engineer and he&#39;s a junior product manager. He has someone directly to report too that he like, can&#39;t necessarily treat that way. And like, he&#39;s with a new group of people that like, he, he is not like the big fish,  you know,

**Michelle Chen:**         It just bothers me that like people will change how they act. Like they have like a boss

**PT:**         Yeah, I know, I know

**Michelle Chen:**         But it&#39;s like just fundamentally like these--cause they&#39;re still bad people, you know, and like, I don&#39;t know, maybe I&#39;m just thinking too much about it--

**PT:**         No, no I don&#39;t think you are. But like, like these

**Michelle Chen:**         Like these are the people you&#39;re going to like make start ups and like occupy these spaces and that that&#39;s, that&#39;s what really bugs me about it. It&#39;s like I see them and I interact with them in classes. It makes me not want to ever work with anyone like them like in the real world and I guess everyone&#39;s experiences are different though. So that&#39;s,

**PT:**         Yeah. I don&#39;t know, I just like, like I don&#39;t like, I don&#39;t know, like yeah, maybe it&#39;s also that like, especially in professional spaces like I think my presence like carries a little more weight because of my dad, you know, like, which is kind of weird to say. But it does give me the sense of like if I&#39;m gonna like fucking make some sort of bratty little comment, like fine, listen to me, you know, like, like I don&#39;t like I don&#39;t necessarily feel as much at the bottom of the totem pole

**Michelle Chen:**         What about in classes? Do you feel like that holds weight for people?

**PT:**         No, because most people don&#39;t know.

**Michelle Chen:**         Interesting. Do you prefer it that way?

**PT:**         Yeah. And it was something that gave me a lot of grief in the beginning of my professional career. Like people like especially to Github because my dad made git and my mom was just like, you know what, like fine, they like owe him one anyway cause he gave them a platform for their product. So go out there and take it, you know like, like ask the questions and like take it and be grateful and learn like you know.

**Michelle Chen:**         Interesting.

**PT:**         And at Echo, they actually hired me not knowing, but they found out like a little while later they found out after they hired but like they hired me not knowing. So that kind of felt good.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. I guess do your friends share the same sentiments as you about like experiences in compsci and like not feeling welcome in certain spaces or not needing certain spaces or do you feel like your story is very much like--

**PT:**         I don&#39;t know.

**Michelle Chen:**         Like do you guys ever talk about like shitty guys?

**PT:**         Yeah me and Jasmine love talking about how much we hate men, but like it&#39;s just, it&#39;s, it&#39;s never like I wish we had a girls union. It&#39;s just like--

**Michelle Chen:**         these guys suck.

**PT:**         Yeah, you know.

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you wish there was anything different? Like that like tangibly the classes could do. Or like the department could do.

**PT:**         I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s kind of like, like I, I know there&#39;s tons of stuff they could do. I found this document that like this Stanford professor made that like was about like making CS more inclusive for women. I found it my freshman year, and I sent it to my 201 professor, but it was stuff like, like invite women specifically to your office hours if you&#39;ve noticed they&#39;ve done well in on their tests and be like, you know what, you did amazing on this test. Good job. Or like if you like specifically look out for women who are doing well, congratulate them, point them out, even point them out in front of the class. Like, and I remember he did that at one point. He was like, he was at one point he was like, Melanie did amazing on this test. Good job. Melanie, um, which was, which was cool, but like stuff like that and then reach out to women and ask them to be TAs if you notice, like, like don&#39;t like, like stuff like grading distributions and stuff like that, like don&#39;t make it such a big focus because I think like, just be mindful of what you do, like hurts minorities more because they already feel like they don&#39;t belong. But like it was this whole long document of Blah Blah Blah. I send it to my 201 professor.

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you remember what it was called? I&#39;m going to try to find it.

**PT:**         No, but I can find it in my like Duke email probably. Yeah, it was kind of cool. I don&#39;t know if the whole Google doc is still up or anything. It was like my freshman year, but it was nice. It was just stuff that like, like sometimes I hear that CS profs like doing their little tiny best to do it. Like by best I mean nothing at all and they&#39;re like, Oh yes, Barbara Liskov invented view something like I can&#39;t even think of it, some like raft protocol. But like she invented it and he&#39;s like yeah, and she didn&#39;t get any credit for it, which is just foolish. She&#39;s like a pioneer in her field and she&#39;s wonderful. I&#39;m like, good job. He&#39;s like, yeah, and I just know like women in cs have to work so much harder. I&#39;m like, you know what you&#39;re saying words but like damn, like, I don&#39;t know.
