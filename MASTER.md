Improving Retention and Representation of Women in Computer Science

I. INTRODUCTION

  As a female, people are often surprised that I am a Computer Science major and I commonly receive questions about gender representation in my classes and remarks about how rare a female Computer Scientist is. This is a common problem for all women Computer Scientists that has, and continues to persist among undergraduate students. I realized that there is more underlying importance of females in the Computer Science field than I had originally believed and I care about researching this further to understand my role in education, how I will be perceived in this field as a woman, and how I can help younger women succeed in Computer Science as well. I found that there are many misconceptions surrounding CS, especially for females, and in a growing field of prosperous jobs, women should feel supported and encouraged to enhance the field. Females are commonly underrepresented with low retention rates in Computer Science classes and face many barriers within the field (Fisher, 1997).This leads to a toxic environment to succeed for women within Computer Science and a tendency for them to choose another major or switch to a less male dominated field (Roberts, 2002). Research does show promising intervention strategies and teaching methods for universities to implement that lead to an equal distribution of women and men in the CS major, proving that this is a matter of teaching factors rather than inherent female characteristics (Cohoon, 2001, p. 109). A number of institutions have implemented positive and conscientious strategies that successfully maintain equal distributions and retention rates for women and men (Cohoon, 2001). Overall, women must help each other transcend the misconceptions surrounding Computer Science in order to promote a higher female representation in the field and break barriers that claim women cannot be Computer Scientists.

II. WHY FEMALES ARE UNDERREPRESENTED

  There are a plethora of reasons why women are underrepresented in Computer Science and different factors affect some women more than others. However, the most common reasons involve stereotypes surrounding the major, lack of role models and same sex peers, inferior prior knowledge as their male counterparts, and a lack of confidence overall (Fisher, 1997).

  Computer Science is a unique field, and the dominant stereotype does not always promote it in the most favorable light, especially when marketed towards women  (Roberts, 2002, p. 84-5). Allan Fisher describes that most people believe a typical Computer Scientist is &quot;the myopic, narrowly focused, young male who sits at his computer all day&quot; (1997, p. 109). This classifies CS majors as antisocial, computer obsessed nerds who are only interested in programming because of the heavy workload; however, most Computer Science students do not feel as though they fit this stereotype (Fisher, 1997, p. 109). By having this stereotyped enforced through rumors, women are deterred from even taking a Computer Science class because they do not feel as though they fit this stereotype and fear that they will be isolated from the other students in the class (Wilson, 2002, p. 144). On the contrary, if women still choose to pursue CS classes despite these false generalizations, they are at a high risk to experience stereotype threat. This enforces women&#39;s feelings of isolation in this field because they feel as though they are not as equipped or dedicated as males (Beyer, 2003, p. 52). Additionally, there is a false consensus among young students that Computer Science is solely dedicated to programming (Fisher, 1997, p. 109). Often times students, especially women, experience anxiety or disinterest in coding and do not realize that there is much more to the field than they anticipated (Fisher, 1997, p. 109). This misunderstanding of later classes decreases the retention of women as they see only programming as their future for a Computer Science path, which is untrue as there are a variety of aspects in later courses.

  Another main reason for the low retention rates of women in Computer Science is the lack of female role models and female peers in the classes (Roberts, 2002, p. 84). A strong factor regarding retention of women is advisement and positive reinforcements of success by other women in the field (Rayman 1995, p. 390). Explicitly by seeing other women doing well in the Computer Science field increases a woman&#39;s self-motivation and confidence (Wilson, 2002, p. 145). Additionally, women are implicitly influenced through verbal persuasion. Without a role model to tell them that they could succeed and do as well as the males in the classes and jobs, many females would never consider majoring in CS (Wilson, 2002, p. 145). Women already start off with higher math anxieties and biases from society as being worse than males in mathematical fields and need an extra support system, through role models, to encourage them to believe that they have the ability to pursue Computer Science despite what society may implicitly be telling them (Wilson, 2002, p. 146). Once women do enroll in CS classes, however, they are often faced with an overwhelmingly unbalanced gender distribution. In classes like these, where collaboration is essential for understanding and exploring new concepts, there is an intense social bias for women because they do not have many women peers to provide support (Roberts, 2002, p. 84). Females report having mixed experiences with the males in their classes, sometimes being able to get positive help, while other times having males make them feel stupid because of their gender (Fisher, 1997, p. 110). Paula Rayman reports that women in single sex colleges have much higher persistence rates in the sciences than women at co-ed institutions because of the increased resources for collaboration and direct support (1995, p. 391).

  Furthermore, women&#39;s interest in Computer Science begins at a later age than males (Beyer, 2003, p. 52).  Because of this, women have less prior experience than men with computers in both gaming and programming (Wilson, 2002, p. 143). This is also evident in the gender representation of high school CS courses. In 2017, 27% of the AP Computer Science test takers were female, a percentage that is deemed extremely impressive, although not even a third of high school computer scientists are females (Jones, 2017). Males are commonly more involved in &quot;tinkering and unguided exploration&quot; of computers than females during their high school years that are important for forming a familiarity with programming before college courses (Fisher, 1997, p. 107).  Further research shows that women commonly take more time and have a gradual appreciation for computers because of their many obstacles, whereas males generally experience &quot;epiphany moments&quot; where they fall in love with computers (Fisher, 1997, p. 108). This also speaks against the myth that women are not inherently gifted at Computer Science and rather supports the argument that the obstacles and departmental factors are what stand in the way of women&#39;s appreciation for computers (Fisher, 1997, p. 108).

  Finally, one of the largest reasons for women&#39;s lack of representation and retention in Computer Science courses is the low confidence that they have in their abilities overall. In a study conducted in a Carnegie Mellon introductory CS course, over half of the men reported that they felt highly prepared for this class whereas not even one woman reported that they felt highly prepared or an expert in at least one language (Fisher, 1997, p. 107). Another study found that even male non-majors were more confident in their coding abilities than female majors, a shocking statistic that does not hold true with actual ability (Beyer, 2003, p. 49). Furthermore, females with high ACT Math scores were found to also be less confident in their math abilities when compared to men with the same ACT Math scores (Beyer, 2003, p. 51). These examples show that women are greatly misinformed about their abilities in comparison to their male counterparts and consistently believe that males are superior in grades and ability when there is no major difference in grades (Beyer, 2003, p. 49). The low confidence in female coders is incredibly problematic because confidence is what ultimately drives aspirations, goals, and choices for a challenging and rewarding education. Without confidence, women have a much lower drive to continue in Computer Science courses or even to take an introductory level course, even though they have to ability to code as well as men (Beyer, 2003, p. 52). This lack of confidence is difficult to combat for many women, but there is a leveling process where women eventually become more confident if they persist in the courses (Fisher, 1997, p. 107). To get to this point, however, most women must go through &quot;a very difficult period of adjustment, facing tremendous self-doubt, and feelings of isolation and inadequacy&quot; (Fisher, 1997, p. 107). This is an additional, unnecessary boundary between women and majoring in a science field that they should not have to combat.

III. WAYS TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN WOMEN IN COMPUTER SCIENCE

  Schools do exist with equal distributions and retention rates of male and female CS students, proving that this is, again, not a problem dependent on women&#39;s abilities, but on how teaching and schools are operated (Cohoon, 2001). An increase in women faculty that teach to strengths, more female peers overall, and breaking the negative stereotypes surrounding Computer Science were the main ways that schools were able to retain women on an equal level as men (Cohoon, 2001).

  The presence of women faculty in the Computer Science department is important for female retention, especially if the faculty specifically looks out for female students (Cohoon, 2001, p. 109). The faculty that viewed learning as a joint responsibility of both the teacher and the student and that learning is not dependent on inherent capabilities of the student showed the most success for students (Cohoon, 2001, p. 113). Furthermore, department heads who recognize these abilities in faculty members and assign their jobs accordingly helps students to receive teachers who care about teaching and who are best suited for teaching over other departments such as research (Cohoon, 2001, p. 113).  Another important aspect of female faculty and role models for students is the idea of &quot;stepping stone role models&quot;  (Roberts, 2002, p. 84). These are women available at various levels of the department to offer more effective mentoring abilities for students. Younger computer scientists are able to obtain insight from first undergraduate Teaching Assistants at a more relatable level rather than seeking out PhD professors or graduate students, especially if they are already intimidated by the Computer Science courses to begin with (Roberts, 2002, p. 85). This is also important for women with little previous coding experience to hear from successful women in the field that may have also started out in similar conditions, thus proving that success in this field is possible for women at any level. This helps combat younger students&#39; fear or lack of confidence in taking or continuing through CS courses and also allows them a trustworthy contact to help guide them through tricky classes or other obstacles (Fisher, 1997, p. 107).

  At universities such as Stanford, their Computer Science department aims to increase overall student numbers in introductory courses that subsequently leads to more women being exposed to programming (Roberts, 2002, p. 84). Their introductory class appeals to a wide audience of not only majors but anyone with an interest to explore computing. Furthermore, this is a widely passed class and makes sure to include female role models to support retention of females (Roberts, 2002, p. 85). This leads to a domino effect of more women taking the class, being supported by each other, taking more upper level computer science classes, and subsequently becoming role models for the future female Computer Scientists (Roberts, 2002, p. 85). There is an extreme importance of female peers within CS classes, on one hand for the social reasons and another for approachable resources. In a social sense, people who are most similar to you indirectly have an influence on your activities and therefore persistence within classes (Cohoon, 2001, p.112). Females offer each other an avenue for approachable help as well. In collaborative classes where help from peers makes all the difference in learning and obtaining higher grades, females are often intimidated to work with males as they already have a low self confidence in their abilities (Cohoon, 2001, p. 112). Others have had problems with teasing and discrimination based on their gender when attempting to work with male students that would deter them in the future from reaching out to males (Cohoon, 2001, p. 12). Thus, having other female peers to support each other and influence success within the class is a powerful way to make female Computer Scientists the status quo.

  Thirdly, breaking the myths surrounding Computer Science students and the classes as a whole is important in recruiting and retaining women. Breaking the false stereotypes that surround the &quot;type&quot; of student that CS students have to conform to for success is the first step to getting women to enroll in CS classes (Fisher, 1997, p. 109). This is done by realizing that successful Computer Science students are not antisocial, but focused on and encouraged to collaborate with each other, and that they have other interests other than solely computers and gaming. By women also understanding that the successful students are not only males is encouraging for them to explore Computer Science classes because they do not feel isolated by their gender or personality (Fisher, 1997, p. 109). The next challenge is retention once women choose to take introductory Computer Science classes. As older Computer Science students soon realize, the later CS classes require much less programming and deviate greatly from the introductory level classes that might be a difficult transition for women (Fisher, 1997, p. 110). These early computer science classes do not depict an accurate representation of the major or future jobs as a whole, thus deterring women from exploring the field further early on in their academic careers (Fisher, 1997, p. 110). Lastly, once students break the stereotypes of the kinds of personalities that computer scientists have and realize that programming is not the end all be all to CS classes, they must realize the job market for Computer Scientists and how prosperous many of the careers can be (Cohoon, 2001, p. 109). There is a huge need for technologically educated students and many jobs go unfilled in this field (Beyer, 2003, p. 49). Many women, however, do not realize the vast opportunities that open for them if they choose to major in Computer Science. Beyer found that women underestimate salaries for CS jobs by a substantial amount, enough to affect their involvement in the major because they may not see a big enough reward for the many obstacles that they are facing (Beyer, 2003, p. 51). Classes also do not show the full range of job opportunities and having companies interact with students, or professors teaching about different possibilities for post graduation careers and their prosperity early on in CS classes is incredibly important for all students, especially women, to learn about the applicability of a potential major in this field (Fisher, 1997, p. 110).

IV. CONCLUSION

  In a job market with many unfilled technological careers each year, an increase of students in the Computer Science major is necessary. Women&#39;s representation is bleak in comparison to the men&#39;s and increasing the recruitment and retention efforts of universities is vital in order to fulfill career gaps in the job market (Beyer, 2003, p. 49). In addition, in order to boost female Computer Scientist role models for future generations and ethically have a larger representation of females in a currently male dominated field, universities must implement retention strategies for women. Due to obstacles mainly due to stereotypes, their lack of female role models and peers, less prior exposure to computers as males, and a lack of self confidence, women lack the desire to pursue Computer Science as a serious major option and instead choose to major in a less male dominated field and with a better reputation  (Roberts, 2002). Many undergraduate colleges have promisingly begun to combat these obstacles with much success through increased representation of women faculty and stepping stone role models, more female peers taking CS classes, and breaking the negative and false stereotypes surrounding Computer Science as a major (Cohoon, 2001). By continuing these efforts, women can feel more comfortable in their computing interests and realize that there are many prosperous opportunities for them and that they have a major influence on future generations of women Computer Scientists.

  Hey, just sending you encouragement to finish this CompSci evaluation project that you interviewed me for. It is super important because the people who the faculty interact with are too often the people who benefit DukeCS's current practices and who are not affected or disuaded from the major because of gender/race/class/disability etc. I don't think that DukeCS faculty hear our side of the story, so they might not feel the urgency that they need to. You have the opportunity to tell our experiences and critiques of the CS department. I just filled out their little survey and I realized that I one. I felt like my 4 years in CS constantly told me how much I didn't know, but also made sure that I didn't feel confident while doing anything related to CS. Those little learning objectives they had were lowkey hurtful cause I feel like not only do I not remember how to do those things, but I can remember thinking that I did and then Duke drilling it into my head that I didn't. lmao. So all that to say, I'm rooting for you. Finish this project. Even if you just show the department transcripts upon transcripts. That would be amazing... nah, just the fact that you thought of this and are making progress is great. and You never know what this could turn into or how it will make things better down the line. Even if you don't like what you write now, we can still petition the CS department to do better as alumni, using the interviews you are conducting. ❤ ❤ ❤  lol sorry if this is too much, but yeah just how I feel. now I gotta stop procrastinating on my paper

**MIKE'S EMAIL:**

Hey Michelle, I know this email might seem random. But since you blocked me on all other channels and I lack the balls to say it face-to-face, I think this is the best way. It still bothers me when I think about the incident last summer. With less than 2 months left of school, I feel like it is silly to hold grudges for that long and it would continue to bother me if I don't apologize and try to fix the situation.

I'm genuinely sorry for my attitude and behavior towards you in 310. Looking back now, I was kind of an asshole and completely at fault. I have realized, intentionally or not, that my words and actions might have hurt you. Whether it is due to my ego or my insecurities, I am aware that there is a problem and I'm trying to fix it to become a better person. I'm also sorry for being so immature and saying stuff behind your back. 

I hope you would accept my apology and we could still be friends.

Best,

Mike

**MY RESPONSE:**

Mike,

I hope all is well. First off, I really appreciate you reaching out and trying to reconcile the situation. In all honesty, this is something that has deeply bothered me too, even though I haven’t attempted to contact you since the incident over the summer. I agree that it is silly to hold grudges for so long, especially given that we’re graduating. I hope we can still be friends as well.

Before I continue, I want to apologize for the things I said to you over the summer. They were wholly uncalled for, untrue, and undeserved. I was hurtful, and I should have never let what happened or what I heard you say about me color the way I treated you, regardless of how hurt I felt. What I said was out of line, and choosing those words instead of talking to you about it was immature of me. I’m sorry. 

In a few words, your email and your words mean a lot to me. I appreciate your apology; all is forgiven.

I think that maybe if I explain a little about my perspective/experiences, it might help you understand my reaction to what you said and how you treated me. My journey in CS at Duke has not been a smooth one. As you know, I chose to pursue a career post-graduation in finance instead of tech, which seems rather counterintuitive for someone who spent four years taking classes geared towards a SWE job. That is not without reason. 

I had never been exposed to CS before Duke, but loved my experiences and first exposures to the major in 101 and 201. After taking 201, I decided to take 308 because I wanted to see what a potential career in CS looked like. In my third group project, I was put in a group with four guys, one of whom constantly berated me for my code, deleted/forced pushed over my contributions to the git repo, and told me “you have no idea what good code or design is” and “you’re wasting my time with your questions”. This really, really impacted how I saw myself both as a student and a programmer. My first “real” experience with coding showed me that I apparently didn’t know what I was doing, was a useless contributor, and couldn’t build anything of worth for my team. I kept going with the major because I was in a little too deep at that point having taken another 101, 201, 230 and the math prereqs, and I thought I could maybe somehow find my love for CS again. 

My experience in 310 reminded me in many ways of my time in 308. I felt like my opinions and time weren’t valued, that I was being ignored in favor of just you and Hannah working together without me, and that I wasn’t really respected as a friend, student, or teammate. It really sucked to hear the things you said about me, because I really honestly considered you a friend and respected you a lot as a teammate. I looked up to you in many ways—you were (and are) hard working, intelligent, and fun to be around. That is why I was so hurt by the way you treated me throughout the course of 310 and in the months after. I feel like friends should support friends, regardless of their experience, intelligence, or subject knowledge.

I felt belittled and undervalued, and I think that this deeply impacted the way I interacted with both you and Hannah. It was really hard to see time after time that you two would work without me, that I had to consistently ask to be included, and then after the fact, that you would tell your friends that I was lazy and didn’t know what I was doing. It made me feel like I was in 308 again, that I wasn’t good enough, and that I didn’t belong. Hearing you say to my face that I would probably barely pass 330 stung as well—how was I supposed to feel going into that class, knowing that someone who I thought was my friend looked down on me like that? I didn’t quite understand the point of some of your remarks later on either—they only served to make me like you less and doubt myself.

Having said all of this, I know that I’m not stupid. I don’t need someone to tell me that, I can see it in my own accomplishments and GPA, from my interactions with people on campus, and from my other experiences. But still, it is hard I think for anyone to hear such things said behind their back from someone who they considered a friend. 

It’s difficult to put into words the way that I felt all of last year, and I don’t want to make this email too long, but I’m glad that we are at least starting the conversation again. I appreciate you taking the time to read this, and hope you can at least now understand some of where I’m coming from.

I hope you have a great weekend!

Best,
Michelle

## Interview Transcriptions 

<details><summary>Interviewee - PT </summary>
<p>
  
**Michelle Chen:**         Ok, so I think I&#39;m recording. So, basically I have like two sets of questions that I&#39;m trying to combine, but it might just end up just as... I think that it honestly would be better just as like a conversation? So wherever it goes. So I guess the first question is, what year are you at Duke?

**PT:**         I&#39;m a junior.

**Michelle Chen:**         And did you have any computer science education prior to Duke?

**PT:**         Yeah, I did. Um, uh, my dad is a software engineer, so I kind of grew up like knowing about that world but also like I both like took and like taught computer science based classes at my high school. So yeah, I mean it wasn&#39;t like super extensive but then also the summer before I came to Duke I had a documentation internship at um, at uh, an IT automation company where I&#39;m from in Portland, so I did a lot of like software adjacent and stuff there and like was paid for it. So like I kind of had a sense of like, I guess my value as a worker coming into Duke.

**Michelle Chen:**         Did you take any like classes in high school?

**PT:**         Yeah, um only one. Oh my God, I had a python independent study that one, like, so badly because I was fucking around on Code Academy. But I also took a visual basic class my senior year. Um, actually that was a huge mess because my best friend sat next to me and he would always like copy off me, and I like didn&#39;t care because I would just do my own work and he would just look over and like copy off my screen--

**PT:**         Your code?

**PT:**         Yeah. And then we got like scare quotes, caught for scare quotes, plagiarizing and like I got in almost as much trouble as he did. I was like, this is such bullshit. Like he just looked at my screen but he totally took the fall and it was fine, like I mean it was whatever, but it like this whole thing, it was funny. But I also, like I taught a class on autonomous vehicles at my school and so we had to use Arduino, and Arduino is is like a C derivative.

**Michelle Chen:**         So I guess like what did the demographics of that [class] look like in high school? Like male, female wise.

**PT:**         Like all boys. My high school was really, really white. So like, like it was literally 97 percent white I think, um, maybe less. But it was also only 200 students. My high school was really white, but there would be like, like I remember in the um CS class that I like the, when I taught, but also in the one I took, like it would be mostly like white boys and then like um, a couple like women and like some women of color or like I think there was one.

**Michelle Chen:**         Ok. And at Duke, have you taken-- which of these have you taken? 308, 310, and 330.

**PT:**         I&#39;m in 310.

**Michelle Chen:**         And you haven&#39;t taken 308 or 330?

**PT:**         I&#39;m about to take 330.

**Michelle Chen:**         OK. So did your family or do your family and friends encourage you to study computer science?

**PT:**         Uh, yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         Like in what ways or if they do or they don&#39;t.

**PT:**         My like family is like, my dad is in computer science. I, it was always just there. I think for for him it&#39;s like a point of pride that I&#39;m studying this major that&#39;s so like quote unquote useful and like, you know, like of course that is a useful major. I think they wouldn&#39;t care what I did, but like you know, you can tell when your parents are like happy with you versus not happy with you, especially because I have, I do have what I consider like a pretty like impressive professional like resume if not academic at all, but like professionally, like I think they really appreciate that. Um, my friends are like girls like, you know, it&#39;s like girls in STEM. So like haha like. Also my best friend is a computer science major or so we like help each other out.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. Well I guess that leads to my next question which is: who you surround yourself in classes, group work, research experiences, and other aspects of compsci learning?

**PT:**         Like only women. Like I don&#39;t really have boy, like male friends anyway that much. Especially not straight men. I&#39;m just not friends with them but like a lot, a lot of like computer science girls as much as possible but also like in my selective living group I guess just like it&#39;s, it&#39;s random. It&#39;s not necessarily computer science. My closest friend is a computer science major and like a lot of my other friends that I like love and look up to like you like computer science,

**Michelle Chen:**         So I guess, like why do you think you chose those individuals to surround yourself with?

**PT:**         I mean my best friend and I met in compsci 201 [laughs], so that&#39;s why we&#39;re friends. I spent like a year and a half in Pratt so um, that&#39;s where I met like, like it&#39;s freshman year and second year, first semester sophomore year I spent in Pratt, so like that&#39;s who I would spend the most time with. Um, my ex boyfriend is in Pratt so like I would spend time with him and then like in my selective living group, like in Mirecourt we would like-- if I need help with an assignment I&#39;ll talk to the computer science kids and stuff like that. But like other than that, I&#39;ll just be friends with the kids on my selective living groups. So it&#39;s not necessarily like sectioned by major.

**Michelle Chen:**         So you don&#39;t think it&#39;s intentional that you like, especially in comp sci, like to try to surround yourself with women or like not straight men?

**PT:**         No, I just don&#39;t like having male friends.

**Michelle Chen:**         In general, not just in CS?

**PT:**         Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         That&#39;s fair. Me either. All my friends are girls or gay. And then I guess, so then do you think your experience in compsci has been different than most male experiences--

**PT:**         Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         And if so, how?

**PT:**         Wow. I just really said knee jerk, yeah. But like, oh my God. Like I just remember me and my best friend Jasmine, like coming across this realization that it&#39;s OK to be like average, you know. Which like, I don&#39;t think any dude has ever had to be like, &quot;hey, it&#39;s OK to be average&quot;, because like, first of all they&#39;re all already so fucking average.They&#39;re like &quot;I&#39;m so great&quot; and I&#39;m like, &quot;shut up&quot;.  Um, so like there&#39;s that, but then just like, I don&#39;t know, I think it&#39;s a very different experience in office hours, like dudes being really unafraid to like put themselves fucking first on the list or like ask really stupid questions. Like I feel so scared asking a really stupid question and then this guy will be like, &quot;how do I set up my git repo&quot;? And I&#39;m like, &quot;are you kidding me? You&#39;re really wasting all of our time with that.&quot; I would NEVER ask that. Ever. I&#39;d be so embarrassed. Um, yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         I mean, I guess on that, I feel the same way. Do you think like, why do you think that? That&#39;s something I&#39;ve never understood.

**PT:**         Because. Because I think because If I ask something like &quot;um, how do I set up my git repo?&quot;, like something that, like they&#39;re going to be like &quot;This stupid fucking girl. Like why is she here? Just like fucking look it up. Stupid girl&quot;, you know? But like a dude does that all the time and like maybe people like kind of roll their eyes but like no one&#39;s like &quot;this stupid fucking, this stupid boy&quot;.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. And do you think that&#39;s like magnified in compsci though?

**PT:**         Yeah, I haven&#39;t really noticed anywhere else, I guess.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, I mean that&#39;s how I feel to. In some of my experiences, like people literally are like &quot;you&#39;re a stupid fucking girl&quot; and they like delete my code, but if a guy does that, it&#39;s just like, oh, he just didn&#39;t like, you know?

**PT:**         Yeah. Otherwise it&#39;s like, I&#39;ll get like, like I had a TA sit with me for literally like an hour and a half in office hours and some other guy was like, &quot;hey man, can we, um, move the TAs around?&quot; Because that&#39;s a fair question, I agree. And the TA was just like, you know what, I&#39;m going to finish up helping her, and then I&#39;ll continue on. And I was like, [laughs] you&#39;ve spent so much time with me, like why is that?

**Michelle Chen:**         Wait like why do you think that was?

**PT:**         I talked to my friend about it or like my friend who&#39;s a guy who&#39;s also a TA for that class. And I was like, &quot;oh my God, X TA spent like an hour and a half with me I couldn&#39;t believe it&quot;. I was like, &quot;why did he do that&quot;? And he was like, &quot;oh, probably because you&#39;re pretty and a girl&quot;.

**Michelle Chen:**         Oh, interesting. So, but do you think that is helpful? You know, like, or do you think it&#39;s like, like is it something you like?

**PT:**         You know, like if someone&#39;s going to give me extra help for something I can&#39;t control then like fuck it, give me that. You know? Like I don&#39;t care.

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you think was, do you think, do you feel like it was like the situation in 250 where he was expecting--the TA was expecting something to come out of it?

**PT:**         No, because like I also like know the TA, like, like we were like relative, I mean we&#39;re not friends, but I&#39;ve had conversations, and like talked to him and seen him outside of a CS context.

**Michelle Chen:**         That&#39;s fair. OK. So let me see. Um, in what ways is your gender impacted your experiences as a computer science major in classes, or research, or any other CS environment?

**PT:**         I don&#39;t know. I think we&#39;ve just talked about that.

**Michelle Chen:**         OK, yeah, that&#39;s fair. Like beyond classes or office hours do you feel like you&#39;ve seen it anywhere else in compsci?

**PT:**         I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t affiliate myself that much with like CS communities. I used to be on the exec team for hockey, which I left but like I also like that&#39;s not, that&#39;s a programming as in like it&#39;s an events programming committee rather than like an actual, like computer science thing. And like I had ACM but like I just don&#39;t do anything so it doesn&#39;t matter.

Speaker 4:        What about group projects? Have you taken group project based classes?

**PT:**         Yeah like I deliberately choose to work with my friends and then like my friends were mostly women so I&#39;ll have at least one person like on my side. We have like, like in the current, like 310 group, our  third partner who&#39;s a dude, he&#39;s bad at communicating and he&#39;s like, he just ends up doing all the work because he doesn&#39;t communicate to us what we need, but like honestly I don&#39;t care. I&#39;m like, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a gender based. I just think it&#39;s a dude who&#39;s bad at communicating.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, that&#39;s fair. And then do you feel like it&#39;s better to work with only women or like work with other women in cs? Because like honestly I&#39;m asking that just because

**PT:**         I would only ever want to have at least one on my side. Like me working in a group with only boys sounds like hell to me. I just would not do it.

**Michelle Chen:**         That&#39;s like been some of my--that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking because like I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve just been looking back on my experiences and I feel like that&#39;s been some of my...

**PT:**         I would never do it.

**Michelle Chen:**         But some of it&#39;s like, mandatory. Like 308, it was mandatory that I was with a group of four guys and it was, it was terrible. Like there, you&#39;re right, there&#39;s no one on your side, you feel like the stupid girl who can&#39;t ask any questions and then like, I don&#39;t know.

**PT:**         And there&#39;s this like, like dudes love to like pretend. Oh my God, I just remember this one dude who like, he&#39;s ECE/CS so like I had a ton of like CS classes and ECE classes with him when I was still ECE and he was always like pretending like he worked so hard and like literally I had like ECE 110 with him and we like weren&#39;t in the same like you have to like build a robot in a group of two. And I was like, with this kid who like I loved having as a partner, he was like funny and we got along really well. But this other--like, like I felt like I knew what I was doing, I&#39;m like, it was Arduino, so like I had literally had like two to three years of experience with that already. Like I knew what it was up. And like the kid who was my partner, like we worked really well together and like he was able to be like, &quot;yeah, let&#39;s go&quot;. Like it was good. And this kid would come up to us, and be like, &quot;hi, do you need any help?&quot; And we would be like &quot;what?&quot;, and he&#39;d be like, &quot;do you need help with yours?&quot; and we were like, &quot;no, we finished&quot;. And he&#39;d be like really, really surprised and then wander off and they would like come to show that like he didn&#39;t know, like his group was like failing. And then there was like another one.

**Michelle Chen:**         So he asked you if you needed help during this class?

**PT:**         Yes. And then he and then he like his group, like their robot didn&#39;t work. And then there was like another time in the same class where like I was asking the TA to like make a certain part of our project easier. I was like, &quot;oh, can we start on this ramp and then program it to go like basically backwards through this circuit instead of like starting on the circuit and then going up the ramp?&quot;, which is much more difficult to do. I mean I&#39;m like fucking like explaining this so poorly. But whatever. Like basically the Ta was like, &quot;haha, yeah, you can do this&quot;. And I remember complaining and being like, &quot;Ugh, I already coded it the other way, but like, sure I&#39;ll do it&quot;. And this kid, this dude, wanders up and--

**Michelle Chen:**         The same one?

**PT:**         No, different guy. Different guy wanders up and like he&#39;s been like listening and he&#39;s like, &quot;OK, so what you&#39;re going to do is this&quot; and re-explained what the TA had just said to me. And I just stared at him and I was like, &quot;thanks&quot;  and like walked away. I was like, but like me and my partner just laughed about hysterically because we&#39;re like, I can&#39;t believe that just happened. Like and he was speaking just to me. He was like, &quot;what you&#39;re going to do is this.&quot; And literally repeated exactly what the guy said.

**Michelle Chen:**         Did you make eye contact with him? Like why--

**PT:**         He was just standing off to the side.

**Michelle Chen:**         Did you ask, like did you motioned to him at all?

**PT:**         No! [laughs]

**Michelle Chen:**         So he&#39;s literally just came up to you and..

**PT:**         Yes! It was, it was so wack.

**Michelle Chen:**         I&#39;m not surprised. I&#39;m more just like, of course happened to you.

**PT:**         There was one time in EGR 103, when um, I would like with some of the boys in my hall be in the common room during like the Matlab programming and at one point, um, one of the boys was like, &quot;hey pat, did you get this? Like, did you get the question?&quot; I was like, &quot;yeah, I did here you go&quot;, and like passed my computer over to him so he could like, look at what-- I mean, it was fucking 103. Like, is this against the honor code? Yes. I like explained to him my code or my computer was directly in front of him and another kid comes in and he goes, &quot;Oh my God, Patricia, Jack is doing your work for you? Like Jack&#39;s literally typing your code for you&quot;. And I was like, &quot;...he&#39;s copying my code&quot;. The rest of the boys in the room were actually like &quot;boo dude. What the fuck?&quot; Like they like made fun of him, but it just because it was so blatant. But he liked scampered and he liked scampered out the room, but I was just like &quot;are you kidding me?&quot; You think this kid is literally typing code for me? Also like he wasn&#39;t even on my computer. Like he was looking at my computer and typing on his own. And this kid&#39;s like automatic assumption is that he&#39;s doing my assignment for me. Which is insane!

**Michelle Chen:**         Did you know the kid?

**PT:**         Yeah, we were like friends, not the kid I was helping, but the kid who like walked in, he was just being an asshole.  Isn&#39;t that funny?

**Michelle Chen:**         That&#39;s, I mean, yes, funny is a word for it. I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m just like, part of the reason I&#39;m doing this project is because I&#39;m like looking back and I&#39;m just like, there have been things that I&#39;ve laughed about and like shrugged off that honestly, like were pretty fucked up and like really not cool. And like, I don&#39;t know.

**PT:**         I mean, there&#39;s already so much of CS that&#39;s like intensely depressing and unfair. And as I&#39;m like a wealthy white woman with like the most connections in computer science you could ever have, um, so like I&#39;m not going to like take my own experience and be like, ah, you know? It&#39;s been like, because like there&#39;s bigger fish to fry for me.

**Michelle Chen:**         My next question is how do you think your race or race in general, socioeconomic status and other identity factors impacts computer science experiences for people at Duke?

**PT:**         Um, it&#39;s hard for me to even speak for any speak to anyone else&#39;s experience is because mine is so unique. Um, like academically I&#39;m not talented. I think, like I&#39;m just not good at school. That kind of goes like I&#39;m just, I&#39;m just not. Like my at Duke, my focus hasn&#39;t really been academics, and that&#39;s something that I&#39;m fine with whatever. Professionally I&#39;m like-- I&#39;m chewing sorry-- like I don&#39;t think there like an easier higher for interns in the world than me. Like I literally, like the way I got my current internship is like the CEO reached out to me on twitter and was like, &quot;hey are you looking for an internship&quot;? Because I met him out like an open source conference that my dad was invited to like four years ago or like maybe even six years ago.

**Michelle Chen:**         So you feel like it&#39;s hard for you to be like--

**PT:**         I can&#39;t really speak to anyone else but me.

**Michelle Chen:**         Cause you don&#39;t want to be like &quot;woe is me&quot;.

**PT:**         Yeah, cause woe isn&#39;t me. I&#39;m chilling. Like my grades are terrible to be honest and I got really good job offers anyway. So, and like that&#39;s all because of my identity factors. like for me now, even in terms of hiring, like I think being a woman has even helped me because like I&#39;m such an easy like diversity hire that also happens to have a bunch of other like weird assets.

**Michelle Chen:**         Which by the way, why are you recruiting again?

**PT:**         I was going to work in Durham with Colin. I mean, not with Colin, but the reason I was in the area with because of Colin and so I don&#39;t want to be in Durham, if I don&#39;t have to be.  I&#39;m working on a startup in New York.

**Michelle Chen:**         Wait I start June 14th like literally so early. OK like let&#39;s hang out actually.

**PT:**         Mhm. I&#39;m working on the Flatiron district and I&#39;m living in the East village.

**Michelle Chen:**         East village? Oh, that&#39;s a cool place to live.

**PT:**         Yeah I&#39;m excited. I&#39;m subletting from my friend.

**Michelle Chen:**         Wow. Interesting. So you don&#39;t necessarily feel like your like gender, race, gender, socioeconomic has impacted your experiences here? But it definitely does for some people in compsci.

**PT:**         Yeah. I just don&#39;t want to speak to it.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, that&#39;s fair. Um, OK. Let&#39;s see. Do you feel as if there&#39;s a community in which you&#39;re welcome in the Duke CS Department.

**PT:**         No. [Laughs]

**Michelle Chen:**         I love these answers where you&#39;re very like, yes. No, no.

**PT:**         Not at all. I don&#39;t even know what that would look like. I mean the thing is like, like I lead ACM and I choose not to do anything with that because I don&#39;t care. Um, I was on HackDuke, I really don&#39;t feel welcome in the community anymore. It&#39;s something I actively make fun of. Stephanie&#39;s going to Goldman.

**Michelle Chen:**         Really? I haven&#39;t been to a meeting this whole year. Yeah, this whole year.

**PT:**         Well, social good is fucked, right? We&#39;ll both be in New York, I&#39;ll spit on her street if I see her. She&#39;s working for their UX division. I&#39;m like, what UX? She&#39;s cracked as fuck. Anyway, sorry if this interview going to be garbage.

**Michelle Chen:**         No, I&#39;m glad that you were my first because I feel like you&#39;re one of the people who&#39;s OK with me not having this all together.

**PT:**         Well God forbid if you did.

**Michelle Chen:**         OK so you don&#39;t feel like there&#39;s a community in which you&#39;re welcome.

**PT:**         No, but I haven&#39;t like sought one out you know, I don&#39;t like, why would I want to be part of the Duke CS community? Like, it&#39;s all assholes and centrists.

**Michelle Chen:**         Like what--what makes you say that?

**PT:**         Like it&#39;s all either boys who I hate and don&#39;t want to spend time with, or it&#39;s like centrist women who are like, women who code. I&#39;m like OK, whatever,  you know? Like good for you. Kappa Kappa Gamma. Like, cool, you know.

**Michelle Chen:**         Interesting. So do you like--you just feel like the space is full of people that you don&#39;t like?

**PT:**         I think my computer science like goals or whatever or you know, are much more like political.

**Michelle Chen:**         \*drops phone\* Sorry to my transcription.

**PT:**         Um, I think my goals are much more political and I don&#39;t really-- like there&#39;s a couple of people, like individuals who I&#39;ve been very impressed and have like really given me access to some really cool resources. Um, but like as a community, like absolutely not. But that&#39;s all of Duke, you know, like no one to Duke is like particularly like, I mean when I say no one, I don&#39;t mean no one. I think there&#39;s like really great activists at Duke but like the vast majority of Duke is like super centrist and like politically very uninspiring. Like when I think about community, I don&#39;t give a fuck if we have like weekly like Wiring with Women meetings, that&#39;s not what I need. But like instead to have like a radical left computer science community, that would be more interesting to me. But like that&#39;s never going to happen with Duke.

**Michelle Chen:**         Are there places with a radical left?

**PT:**         Yeah, there&#39;s some cool like online communities like um, Tech Solidarity, which is this like um, group that this um, programmer Maciej Ceglowski founded who I really admire but like they like do like political funding for um, like leftist, like non partisan--not non-partisan but non-mainstream leftist candidates which is really cool. And they also are like are pushing for a tech workers union, which is not to like increase funding but rather like a tech workers union that would like give more power to tech workers whose companies like are doing like wildly unfair things, you know, like when Palantir does like predictive policing. If the workers, their workers there have a union then like they can speak out against that.

**Michelle Chen:**         Interesting.

**PT:**         Yeah. Yeah. But that&#39;s the sort of like labor power that Duke students also don&#39;t necessarily have, but like at the same time like, you know, like there&#39;s no one, I don&#39;t know, but like blah blah blah. Yeah. Like I think there&#39;s many reasons that that couldn&#39;t happen at Duke. And I think some of-- like half of them are like Duke students fault, half of them are just like whatever it&#39;s a school, you know, it&#39;s not like we&#39;re doing like labor really. Like it&#39;s not like there&#39;s anything we need to be like fucking unionizing over because we&#39;re undergrads, but like, you know what I mean.

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you think though that there&#39;s something that you need or you want from this community? Like, or are you just like, do you feel like you just don&#39;t want to be a part of them because you don&#39;t need them or do you feel like they could be helpful in some ways, but they&#39;re just not there?

**PT:**         I don&#39;t need them.  Like that&#39;s saying I specifically don&#39;t need them because I don&#39;t need like a &quot;girl gang&quot; quote unquote. And I don&#39;t need networking opportunities. Like if someone else wants that, I&#39;m definitely not like  begrudging them that. And I know that that can be really empowering. It&#39;s just not something I need or want for myself. Like it&#39;s, it&#39;s maybe selfish and it&#39;s maybe just me being realistic.

**Michelle Chen:**         Um, let&#39;s see.  Well I guess. OK. So I do want to ask you specifically, so you&#39;re in 310 now right?

**PT:**         Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         So I want to know about your experiences in that class as a whole. Like when I say 310, like positive, negative, like what? Like what&#39;s your knee jerk reaction? Like?

**PT:**         Um, honestly, like our--this is so bad. I like feel awkward saying this in the interview and having it like be public record or whatever.

**Michelle Chen:**         I can cut it out.

**PT:**         No, no it&#39;s fine. It&#39;s fine. I&#39;m just speaks to like, my lack of academic, like talent. Our like third group member has been doing like so much of the projects for us because he just doesn&#39;t care and he just wants to like bang it out and we&#39;re like, we don&#39;t care enough to be like, &quot;no, let us learn&quot;, you know, like we&#39;re like OK, go, go off I guess. Um, the like it&#39;s called-- ugh God I&#39;m like outing myself in this interview. Um, there&#39;s no way you can put this in and keep me anonymous. It&#39;s called operating systems. So whenever I don&#39;t go to lectures anymore, which is just, I mean, that&#39;s not because of like anything except for--

**Michelle Chen:**         Who&#39;s your professor?

**PT:**         Chase, but like the, like first few lectures, like when he would say like Linux, like people would like look over me and I&#39;d be like, &quot;Hey&quot;, like, &quot;what&#39;s up&quot;, you know, like it didn&#39;t happen that much but like it happened, you know, like sometimes it just happens.

**PT:**         Um, and then like the first, maybe the first week I emailed the professor Chase because I was like, like &quot;can I use my own unix environment? I&#39;ve been using Linux and like I want to use my, like, like I want to use Fedora instead of um Ubuntu&quot;, which is what the class uses. And like I was just wondering if that&#39;s going to work. Like I was, like, of course it will, but like a TA told me it wouldn&#39;t so I just wanted to ask, you know, I was stuntin&#39; a little, um, and he responded back. He was like, &quot;Patricia warm, welcome to the class. Of course I know who you are, but I won&#39;t be mentioning it in class to the rest of the people&quot;. And I was like, thank you so much. Not like I appreciate that discretion and not every student would be as tactful as you, you know?

**PT:**         And then I like went to his office hours to ask him a question about like my code or something and they like, the rest of the kids had been like, waiting out-- this is such a whack story, but it&#39;s kind of funny. Um, the rest of the kids who had been waiting for him were like waiting outside and that like LSRC breakout area and I like rounded the corner and like just opened the door where he was and he was finishing up an email or something like someone else must have come in. And he was like, &quot;give me a second&quot;. And so they were waiting outside and I like rounded the door and opened the door and he was like, &quot;oh, hello!&quot;. And I was like, &quot;hi, how are you&quot;? And he was like, &quot;give me one second&quot;. And then he like immediately, like took, like he closed his computer or whatever and like walked out with me to like break out area. He was looking around. He was like, &quot;uh, yeah, I&#39;m just gonna meet with her real quick and then I&#39;ll come back for the rest of you&quot; even though I clearly just got in there like someone else must have done. It&#39;s like, OK, um, we like went into his office and he was like, &quot;hi, so you&#39;re Patricia&quot;. And I was like, &quot;yes, I am&quot;, you know, I was like, &quot;hey.&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;oh, it&#39;s so good to meet you&quot;. And I was like, &quot;you too&quot;. I mean, he was like, &quot;so what&#39;s the problem&quot;? I was like, &quot;I don&#39;t know, I think I&#39;m just like, fucking like pulling my repository wrong&quot;. I was. Like, it was a fucking git problem it&#39;s embarrassing. And he was like, &quot;just give me your group number and I&#39;ll look over it personally&quot;. And I was like, &quot;OK&quot;, and I like scampered off.

**PT:**         Which like I literally talked to my friend who like does an independent study for him and he was like, that&#39;s weird that he did that for you. I was like, is it? And he was just like, yeah, he couldn&#39;t do that. And I was like, OK, you know. So that was like the first week of class and since then I know that I&#39;ve only let him down with my poor performance in this class and on the mid-terms, so ah, if he&#39;s going to have unrealistic standards for me, I&#39;m just gonna I&#39;m just not going to meet them, you know, and that&#39;s kind of been the vibe there. But yeah, that kind of thing happens sometimes and it&#39;s like,

**Michelle Chen:**         How does it make you feel? I guess I didn&#39;t realize that. Like I forgot. Yeah, that this is a perspective that you could provide because I was thinking more like people in compsci who are just girls.

**PT:**         Sorry, I&#39;m like fucking up your study because this is like a unique perspective.

**Michelle Chen:**         No, I appreciate it.

**PT:**         Um, sometimes you know, like sometimes I just roll with it. I&#39;m like, this is like, I recognize that it&#39;s like, it always benefits me and like it&#39;s like professors giving you personal time and like, you know, stuff like that. Like, like sometimes it hurts my feelings because I&#39;m like, oh, like I&#39;m not gonna live up to your goals. Like, you know, like that suck, you&#39;re setting an expectation for me that I definitely can&#39;t meet. It sometimes makes me feel like embarrassed. Like when Astrachan in our class would be like &quot;Linux&quot; or like, you know, that one time when I was like, &quot;no, this is how it is&quot;. And he&#39;s like, &quot;heheh, I guess you would know&quot;. And I was like [sighs]. Yeah, I didn&#39;t write it, honey, you know, it&#39;s like sometimes a mixed bag of emotions. I like also like I&#39;m really, really proud of what my dad&#39;s accomplished because like I think it&#39;s really amazing and that kind of only becomes more clear as time goes on. That like, holy shit, this is actually really amazing. But like, yeah, it&#39;s just like kind of where we&#39;re at.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, I can see that. That&#39;s. Hm. Do you feel like it&#39;s like a lot of. So you feel like it&#39;s pressure to. Do you feel like he puts like your parents put pressure on, you?

**PT:**         No, my parents like they&#39;re chillin.

**Michelle Chen:**         That&#39;s interesting.

**PT:**         My parents really don&#39;t care. Um yeah I love my parents and how they act about it, which is to say they don&#39;t care and they&#39;re completely normal. Um, uh, what was the question? Like how I feel about it?

**Michelle Chen:**         But I have more, other questions. OK, this is an interesting question that is kind of off topic, but I wrote down: how does, does gender influence how you see your teammates? Because I know you said you like surround yourself with girls, but is there-- like when you see a guy that you don&#39;t know in comp psy, like are you automatically just like, like how&#39;d you find this other guy for your group?

**PT:**         On Piazza. Isn&#39;t that crazy? We found him on piazza because he like just really needed a third because he dropped the group size. Like, oh my god, I&#39;ve never like, our guy is like really good at compsci. Like he does those projects so well, but he&#39;s so bad at communicating and he&#39;s like, like oftentimes like, so... Like faith my other like the girl in my group, um, will like fight him on certain, like coding conventions or certain ways she wants to complete the project. And he&#39;ll be like, no, no, no, and like kinda shut her down. Which like I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s gendered or if it&#39;s just him wanting to do his own thing, you know, like, just because he&#39;s done like so much of the project. Um like, I don&#39;t wanna like ascribe it to gender. Although what can&#39;t be ascribed gender, I don&#39;t know. But like, you know, there was a time where I would like a boy would say something about like cs and I&#39;d be like, oh damn, like he&#39;s probably right. Lately I&#39;ve been like, damn ya&#39;ll are so stupid. Like you don&#39;t know shit, like you don&#39;t know, like fucking Dhruv or whatever will tweet something about like a coding language, and like I think like maybe a year ago I would have been like, I&#39;m so stupid. I&#39;m like, Dhruv, like knows what&#39;s up. Like now I&#39;m like damn, you&#39;re stupid as fuck.

**Michelle Chen:**         Really? That&#39;s interesting. I want to get there.

**PT:**         Like I think like--or like these-- oh my God, Faith and I were studying for the last 310  midterm with these two boys that Faith is close to and one of them is always fucking stepping on my lines. You know, I&#39;ll be like, like some, his friend will be like, can you explain to me how sudo works I have been using Linux my literally entire life. Like my actual entire life. And he&#39;ll be like, &quot;yeah um&quot;, I&#39;ll be like, &quot;yeah, so sudo is&quot; and he&#39;ll jump on my line and be like, &quot;uh it&#39;s a file, which like you change permissions&quot; and I&#39;m like where are you going with this? You&#39;re stupid and you&#39;re also wrong so I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re like, I&#39;m like go ahead and get the wrong answer or like whatever. But like you&#39;re really trying to stunt and you&#39;re shit at this. Like I&#39;ve become very comfortable. I think my role as a junior developer, like as I was interviewing and stuff, I&#39;d be like, &quot;I don&#39;t really know how to do this&quot; during the interview. And they&#39;d be like, &quot;hey, just just look it up&quot;. And I&#39;d be like, you know what? Yeah, I&#39;m a junior developer. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing. And they&#39;d be like, &quot;OK, yeah, sure&quot;. And like kind of like walk me through a little more. But it&#39;s like you know who you&#39;re hiring like you didn&#39;t like, you&#39;re not looking to hire me because like you think I&#39;m not going to act like an intern. You think I&#39;m gonna act like a senior developer.  You&#39;re hiring an intern who&#39;s still in college like so like we&#39;re all kind of stupid and like men especially are so stupid.

**Michelle Chen:**         Like, I mean this is not for the interview, this is just for me, but like how did you, like, how do you get there?

**PT:**         I guess I become like a lot more confident in my professional abilities because I&#39;m like

**Michelle Chen:**         Is it because of your work experiences?

**PT:**         Yeah. Because I&#39;m like three internships deep. And like I also like I know like I don&#39;t have a lot of skills but like some skills I have and like, like you know, I can just like feel comfortable in knowing what I know and also knowing that other people like just love to like stunt. And like if you dig a little deeper into what they think they know, like if you just ask them a few more questions, like, &quot;oh, like what do you mean by that&quot;? Or like, &quot;oh, can you just explain that a little more&quot;? They&#39;re gonna like trip over themselves and get confused because they don&#39;t actually know. It&#39;s like such a surface level understanding.

**Michelle Chen:**         Like I&#39;m like, what did Dhruv say?

**PT:**         Like he tweeted this stupid thing late like it was yesterday and he was, it was like he quote tweeted, oh my phone died. He quote tweeted, like, like, so the original tweet was like software, Stockholm Syndrome. Like when a technology is too bad, like when a technology, when you keep using a technology even when it&#39;s really bad because like you&#39;ve, you&#39;ve taken so much time to learn it and then he quote tweeted it, which means like--is this for the interview?

**Michelle Chen:**         I just want to know.

**PT:**         Like he, like, he like quoted saying like &quot;all of software and Javascript&quot;, which first of all is stupid because like the Venn diagram of like all of software--and javascript is inside that, like it&#39;s not an and it&#39;s like all software, comma, especially Javascript, I don&#39;t know.  But I like responded to it and I was like I disagree because Javascript is both easy to learn--so like directly contrary to this original tweet, and also my favorite language. Like I love Javascript.

**Michelle Chen:**         Did he respond?

**PT:**         Like no, but we talked about it in person. He was like, he was like, &quot;wait Pat, you like Javascript?&quot; I was like, &quot;yeah, I used it for all my technical interviews. I love javascript&quot; Also, it&#39;s easy to learn so it doesn&#39;t make any sense with the original tweet. And he was like, &quot;uh, yeah, I mean I guess I just like, like, you know, I like, like lower level languages&quot; which is classic boy phrase which just means &quot;I&#39;m smart&quot;, like he&#39;s like &quot;I like lower level language cause like C, I mean I guess C isn&#39;t easy to learn or easy to read. But like, I don&#39;t know, I guess it just makes more sense to me&quot; and like, you know,

**Michelle Chen:**         [laughs] so he likes MIPS

**PT:**         Like yeah, yeah, I was like you like MIPS dude?

**PT:**         I was like, you know, like Java scripts are just so extensible and like you get to learn some of the other languages. It was like, oh, I&#39;ve worked so much in node and angular too because of javascript. So like, I don&#39;t know, I guess I just really like it and appreciate it and I also don&#39;t think it&#39;s bad and he was like, &quot;well I don&#39;t know, just different for everyone&quot;. And I was like, fair enough dude, like, but it&#39;s like it&#39;s this little house of cards where like they say or tweet or present themselves in such a way to make themselves seem smart--Dhruv is actually a perfect example. But like if you just like, like you blow in this little house of cards and it&#39;s just like there&#39;s nothing there.

**Michelle Chen:**         So I watched you. I saw you respond to one of his tweets too.

**PT:**         Oh my God. He tweeted about like, oh my  brand is dog memes and Marxism. And I was like never seen you engage in Marxism bro but go off, I guess. Brand yourself.

**Michelle Chen:**         Did he respond to that?

**PT:**         No, he never talked to me. Oh, I tried to talk to him about it but he was really high so he didn&#39;t like react to me. But I was like, you don&#39;t interact with Marxism, nor do you interact with marxist. Like I&#39;m out here in a cultural studies class, like actually thinking and you&#39;re like sitting in your weed cloud like being fucking idiot and like being like ha haha, communism. And I&#39;m like, you&#39;re so stupid. Yeah. I don&#39;t know, like  it&#39;s just this, it&#39;s, it&#39;s become so easy to just like tiny bit like poke at these boys&#39; knowledge and see that there&#39;s nothing underneath.

**Michelle Chen:**         But they present themselves in different ways.

**PT:**         Yeah. That makes you think they do.

**Michelle Chen:**         Maybe it&#39;s because I don&#39;t have enough confidence because I&#39;m thinking about like all my classes where like literally I&#39;ve been explained like this is how it is and this is how it works and you&#39;re just dumb. And then I&#39;m like, yeah, you&#39;re right. Like I&#39;m stupid and I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing.

**PT:**         Yeah I feel really unconfident sometimes too. But like whenever I can like poke at that, like if I even have like that same level of surface level knowledge, like just do it and you&#39;ll see their heads explode.

**Michelle Chen:**         What about, so what is it like, do you feel like this in your internships, like how do they feel different than compsci at Duke?

**PT:**         Yeah, I love my internships.

**Michelle Chen:**         So then like, what&#39;s, what&#39;s different,

**PT:**         My like in my internships, first of all there&#39;s like a sense of fucking professional courtesy, which you don&#39;t get at Duke--

**Michelle Chen:**         But do you actually get that in internship, where people respect your work and

**PT:**         Yes! Well, like, OK, so like my two internships experiences that are actually like aggressively software as opposed to like technical documentation, which is a little different. Like the first one, there were three other interns, um, and a manager like a dedicated manager and then the last one, last summer it was a startup so it was tiny and it was all like, just like older people. But it wasn&#39;t like, it wasn&#39;t a very young startup, you know, like people there were like, like 27 to 30 something, you know, because it was like a medical startup. So they like, like a lot of them were like registered, like pharmacists or like everything else. And then like the engineering team was just a little bit older for it. Um, and in like the um, the one with the other interns like, you know, we&#39;re still like all students we&#39;re still like relatively peers and at one point like the boy, I mean it was a team of three girls and a boy, so I got lucky but they also did that on purpose because it was like they did it as like a professional choice.

**PT:**         But like at one point the boy said something-- like he just used the word like bitch off handedly, but the manager-- like it wasn&#39;t like directed towards any of us, he was like, &quot;oh that&#39;s such a bitch&quot; about something. And like none of us like reacted to it I think. But the manager ended up taking him aside later and being like, &quot;yo, don&#39;t say that&quot;. But also like just the sense of like knowing and being comfortable in the fact that like I&#39;m a junior developer, I&#39;m like a learning person. I got taken on in order to learn and to like bring value to the team in that sense. And not in necessarily a technical skill sense has helped me so much because it makes me feel like, OK, like these people aren&#39;t stupid. They hired me despite knowing that like I&#39;m not going to provide the same value to the team as a full-time engineer because I&#39;m not that and I&#39;m not at that level.

**PT:**         So like being like knowing that fact has helped me so much because it like they hire me because they want low level tasks done because they shouldn&#39;t have senior engineers working on like small fixes that like do improve the service but like waste people&#39;s time if they have like actual, like service architecture to work on, but also to like improve their own mentoring skills which is actually a valuable professional skill to like improve their company&#39;s PR because now they have an intern who&#39;s like out there at a college campus which is a really good recruiting ground. Like bring back full time, which is also really, really valuable. Like all of these things which aren&#39;t necessarily like hard skills that like the company doesn&#39;t need because if they did need it they would hire someone full time.

**Michelle Chen:**         So, I guess like, that&#39;s... Here&#39;s what I was thinking when you were saying that--like you know, how you were talking about like a lot of CS at Duke was like asshole guys, which I totally agree with, but thinking in, sorry, like this is a very disjointed train of thought--in thinking about this project where the guy for 308 appointed himself as like the PM, the project manager in a group of five guys and deleted--he forced to push over my code and like delete my code off like and just like telling me I didn&#39;t know what I was doing and stupid. And like once I was, I told him--have I told you this? I asked him a question. He was like, I just want you to know like you&#39;re a huge waste of my time right now. Like I can&#39;t believe. Like. And he was like, like I know what good design is.  You have no idea. Like it was just like. And now he&#39;s working at Linkedin. OK. And I get that like those are not necessarily

**PT:**         Yeah, but Linkedin is a garbage company.

**Michelle Chen:**         But here&#39;s. But here&#39;s the thing, like these people, these asshole guys are leaving and going into these--that&#39;s the reason why I didn&#39;t want to go into software because--and I get that every tech company is different you can find spaces but does it not bother you that like with every graduating class there&#39;s like the cohort of asshole tech guys going into their asshole tech roles and their hoodies and like they like, you know, like people that we&#39;ve met, like I&#39;m not saying everyone at Interact is like this, but there are people there like that and I was like, like I don&#39;t want it to be.

**PT:**         Yes, I know. And that&#39;s when you see those stories about like, like, like Uber and everywhere else that like it is real Github also. Like that&#39;s where I worked where I had a good experience but like that provides really, really bad experiences for other people. And I know I like, I know, but at the same time like, like there is still a pointed disconnect between a professional experience in which you have like a hierarchical structure. HR, like you know, like at the same time like this kid at Linkedin, like if he&#39;s a product manager or if he&#39;s an engineer, he&#39;s a junior engineer and he&#39;s a junior product manager. He has someone directly to report too that he like, can&#39;t necessarily treat that way. And like, he&#39;s with a new group of people that like, he, he is not like the big fish,  you know,

**Michelle Chen:**         It just bothers me that like people will change how they act. Like they have like a boss

**PT:**         Yeah, I know, I know

**Michelle Chen:**         But it&#39;s like just fundamentally like these--cause they&#39;re still bad people, you know, and like, I don&#39;t know, maybe I&#39;m just thinking too much about it--

**PT:**         No, no I don&#39;t think you are. But like, like these

**Michelle Chen:**         Like these are the people you&#39;re going to like make start ups and like occupy these spaces and that that&#39;s, that&#39;s what really bugs me about it. It&#39;s like I see them and I interact with them in classes. It makes me not want to ever work with anyone like them like in the real world and I guess everyone&#39;s experiences are different though. So that&#39;s,

**PT:**         Yeah. I don&#39;t know, I just like, like I don&#39;t like, I don&#39;t know, like yeah, maybe it&#39;s also that like, especially in professional spaces like I think my presence like carries a little more weight because of my dad, you know, like, which is kind of weird to say. But it does give me the sense of like if I&#39;m gonna like fucking make some sort of bratty little comment, like fine, listen to me, you know, like, like I don&#39;t like I don&#39;t necessarily feel as much at the bottom of the totem pole

**Michelle Chen:**         What about in classes? Do you feel like that holds weight for people?

**PT:**         No, because most people don&#39;t know.

**Michelle Chen:**         Interesting. Do you prefer it that way?

**PT:**         Yeah. And it was something that gave me a lot of grief in the beginning of my professional career. Like people like especially to Github because my dad made git and my mom was just like, you know what, like fine, they like owe him one anyway cause he gave them a platform for their product. So go out there and take it, you know like, like ask the questions and like take it and be grateful and learn like you know.

**Michelle Chen:**         Interesting.

**PT:**         And at Echo, they actually hired me not knowing, but they found out like a little while later they found out after they hired but like they hired me not knowing. So that kind of felt good.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. I guess do your friends share the same sentiments as you about like experiences in compsci and like not feeling welcome in certain spaces or not needing certain spaces or do you feel like your story is very much like--

**PT:**         I don&#39;t know.

**Michelle Chen:**         Like do you guys ever talk about like shitty guys?

**PT:**         Yeah me and Jasmine love talking about how much we hate men, but like it&#39;s just, it&#39;s, it&#39;s never like I wish we had a girls union. It&#39;s just like--

**Michelle Chen:**         these guys suck.

**PT:**         Yeah, you know.

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you wish there was anything different? Like that like tangibly the classes could do. Or like the department could do.

**PT:**         I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s kind of like, like I, I know there&#39;s tons of stuff they could do. I found this document that like this Stanford professor made that like was about like making CS more inclusive for women. I found it my freshman year, and I sent it to my 201 professor, but it was stuff like, like invite women specifically to your office hours if you&#39;ve noticed they&#39;ve done well in on their tests and be like, you know what, you did amazing on this test. Good job. Or like if you like specifically look out for women who are doing well, congratulate them, point them out, even point them out in front of the class. Like, and I remember he did that at one point. He was like, he was at one point he was like, Melanie did amazing on this test. Good job. Melanie, um, which was, which was cool, but like stuff like that and then reach out to women and ask them to be TAs if you notice, like, like don&#39;t like, like stuff like grading distributions and stuff like that, like don&#39;t make it such a big focus because I think like, just be mindful of what you do, like hurts minorities more because they already feel like they don&#39;t belong. But like it was this whole long document of Blah Blah Blah. I send it to my 201 professor.

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you remember what it was called? I&#39;m going to try to find it.

**PT:**         No, but I can find it in my like Duke email probably. Yeah, it was kind of cool. I don&#39;t know if the whole Google doc is still up or anything. It was like my freshman year, but it was nice. It was just stuff that like, like sometimes I hear that CS profs like doing their little tiny best to do it. Like by best I mean nothing at all and they&#39;re like, Oh yes, Barbara Liskov invented view something like I can&#39;t even think of it, some like raft protocol. But like she invented it and he&#39;s like yeah, and she didn&#39;t get any credit for it, which is just foolish. She&#39;s like a pioneer in her field and she&#39;s wonderful. I&#39;m like, good job. He&#39;s like, yeah, and I just know like women in cs have to work so much harder. I&#39;m like, you know what you&#39;re saying words but like damn, like, I don&#39;t know. She seems dope. Right? Like she seems super smart, but I would like more tangible support maybe, you know.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, that makes sense.  Any final thoughts?

**PT:**         Oh and I know like Phillip Moss, who I really admire, he held like, like black CS office hours where like, it was just for like black CS kids at Duke like you know what I mean and apparently it was cool. So that&#39;s an excellent.

**Michelle Chen:**         I, I&#39;m interviewing him for this too.

**PT:**         Good, I mean I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll bring it up hopefully, cause he should.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. Well thank you.

**PT:**         You&#39;re welcome.

**Michelle Chen:**         That was, for someone who was like, Oh, I should&#39;ve thought about that. That was very--I know I&#39;m peeling everywhere Patricia and also my hands are peeling. I don&#39;t know if you can see.

**PT:**         My palms are so dry. I don&#39;t know why.

**Michelle Chen:**         I didn&#39;t know that my hands could do that. Like I don&#39;t know why my whole all my skin&#39;s peeling.

**PT:**         Oh the interviews kiss kiss! Wow,  45 minutes. Should I end it?

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

<details><summary>Interviewee - AW </summary>
<p>



**Michelle Chen:**         Ok. So I explained the project, so I guess my first question is 308, 310, and 330. Have you taken all of the and what order did you take them in?

**AW:**         I have. Uh, 308 and then 330 and then 310.

**Michelle Chen:**         Cool. And what year are you at Duke?

**AW:**         Uh, I&#39;m a senior.

**Michelle Chen:**         Ok. So did you have any compsci like education prior to attending Duke?

**AW:**         Uh, yes, I had one year of AP computer science in high school.

**Michelle Chen:**         And like what, what, like what was that experience like and what were the demographics of that class?

**AW:**         Uh, that class was mainly white and East Asian men, uh with some white East and South Asian women and probably like three to one to four to one, it was a couple years ago now. Um and it was fine. It was super easy. Uh, the professor or teacher I guess was extremely understanding and so--I actually think he&#39;s probably the best--I think he&#39;s probably the best compsci teacher I&#39;ve ever had as far as a pure teacher teacher because he understood kind of the difficulty that the students would have with learning this sort of stuff at a very beginning level. So the class was taught in Java, like Basic Java for a semester, then data structures and algorithms for a semester and every assignment was completion. Every could be submitted whenever, just by the end of the year, every test could be retaken as many times as you wanted to. So he made it very easy for you to get a good grade. And he understood that like people, you know, largely pursued programming in high school with the intention at least while they were learning it to be able to make or do something. And so the class, he didn&#39;t really have to worry about using grades to incentivize people. If people couldn&#39;t get something to work, that was the, all the incentive they needed. And so he did a very good job of like making sure that people felt um like there was no other pressure except for that. Yeah, supported for sure.

**Michelle Chen:**         Um, do your family and friends encourage you to study cs?

**AW:**         Um, no.

**Michelle Chen:**         Did your parents?

**AW:**         No, not at all.

**Michelle Chen:**         So, like why did you decide to--

**AW:**         I didn&#39;t in high school I started when I was in college because um, because I could and I thought I was good at it and I think I was really lucky taking compsci 201 in Java as a freshman in the fall where I had already essentially taken a data structures course in Java in high school, so I knew more than a lot of the sophomores because they had taken compsci 101 which is in python, so I had like a pretty strong understanding of Java Syntax and I had no problem. Um, like we, I went, I went like off campus, on of my third or fourth weekends at Duke with a bunch of sophomores in this club I got involved in and we like did homework the first afternoon when we got there and I was able to help like five sophomores on their compsci 201 homework even though like I was just like freshman and that was like super empowering for me. So that&#39;s probably why stuck there at first.

**Michelle Chen:**         And your parents, don&#39;t haven&#39;t like, like don&#39;t care at all?

**AW:**         My parents set the requirement basically that I had to make sure that I could support myself after college and um, and whether or not that was through my major was never really a concern I guess. I don&#39;t know if that had to be through my major or not because I ended up picking a major where that was pretty easy. So I guess I never had to test them at all to see if they would care or not.

**Michelle Chen:**         So I guess in, in comp sci classes, group work, research experiences, whatever your experiences have been in compsci at Duke, who do you surround yourself with?

**AW:**         That&#39;s an interesting one. So I think at first-- I can go, I can go backwards. So I think junior, senior year it was people that I know that are smart because they could help me. I think freshman, sophomore year it was more social based, it was like more people that I want to be friends with and I think the social thing is just like a me thing. I think that&#39;s just like my natural tendency at least was at the time and I think it shifted to like people that are smart because the classes got harder and I needed that help. Um, so that was kind of like how it changed and it was relatively easy to do both those things. But I wouldn&#39;t say that I developed very good friends, like explicitly through comp sci. So the people like freshman, sophomore year, then I surrounded myself with that I wanted to be friends with, I ended up being friends with because we connected over other things.

**AW:**         Um, I don&#39;t think like being a software engineer, being able to code was that part of my, like non-academic life at Duke.

**Michelle Chen:**         And so I guess like is there a certain demographic type? Or like

**AW:**         Ah, yeah I think it&#39;s mostly East Asian or white people? Uh, mostly men, but I mean like I think it&#39;s just like a one off thing, like some of my closest friends, like people that I&#39;m closest to that I met through a campsite, like some of them are, are, are like--yeah of the closest people like I would say half are white, and some are queer. So like it&#39;s not just like the straight white guy and straight East Asian guy.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. And so I guess you sort of brought up the second part of this question, but it was: like why did you choose these people to surround yourself with? And so your answer is at first you wanted to be friends with them, and then you realize they&#39;re smarter. And then, how did you identify who you thought was smart? Just by like word of mouth? Like you saw their performance?

**AW:**         Oh yeah, I think it was, I mean it would be just like I would ask people around me for help and every now and then someone&#39;s response would like blow me away and like just taking with me that they were like, wow, this person&#39;s really freaking smart and I&#39;ll just go ask them for questions because they can explain things well. Um, I don&#39;t think I sought people out. It was more just like I just kinda like floated around on my own until I ran into people that knew what they were doing. I also like didn&#39;t rarely ever consult people who had taken the class in the past because just like people forget stuff and they&#39;re not really that helpful. So.

**Michelle Chen:**         Um, do you think your experience in the computer science major has been different from most female students&#39; experiences?

**AW:**         Yeah, definitely. I mean every professor was my gender. Um I remember in 308, of the three group projects teams, I did one with one male and one female, one with two males and one female and one with 10 males and one female. So, and that the woman in the last group was the same as the woman in the second to last group. So in a course where I worked with in theory, three different teams of varying sizes that I worked with two women total and those teams where it&#39;s three, four, and 12 people.

**Michelle Chen:**         So what about in terms of like--

**AW:**         Oh yeah, yeah, sorry. thinking back to the original question, um...

**Michelle Chen:**         I guess like how do you, how do you think your experience has been different?

**AW:**         Yeah, yeah. Well like. I want to try to-- do you are you, do you want this to be something that can be played back to someone or it&#39;s just for your notes?

**Michelle Chen:**         No so basically I did an interview with someone where I was like typing the whole time and it  didn&#39;t feel like the conversation.

**AW:**         Ok, got you.

**Michelle Chen:**         So this is like for my notes when I type up.

**AW:**         OK. I actually look at you while talking because I&#39;m like trying to phrase this as if it&#39;ll be played back.

**Michelle Chen:**         I mean if someone wants to listen to you, I mean do you care?

**AW:**         No, I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t care. But it&#39;s just more of like some things I can like go back and reference things that you&#39;ve been through, but like if you play this to someone and they don&#39;t know who you are it&#39;ll just be weird.

**Michelle Chen:**         No, it&#39;s just for me and I guess my professor could listen to these if you wanted to, but it&#39;s going to be like, many hours of like...

**AW:**         Yeah, well also like I&#39;m about to say like some like, I don&#39;t know. Just like thinking about like social justice terminology versus like I don&#39;t know.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah this is for me.

**AW:**         Um, so I guess I&#39;ll try to articulate what I think is the way that I would articulate it and this is-- this is rarely articulated, is just throughout every step in the process, men are able to be validated and supported in what they do by people that look like them--sorry--by people that share their gender and women aren&#39;t like that aren&#39;t, but like that aren&#39;t, like has to be couched--and I&#39;m not saying that women are told outright that they can&#39;t succeed. Like that would be like a little bit-- that&#39;d be, that&#39;s kind of like a contrived way of thinking about it. It&#39;s literally just the absence of being told something. Right? And I think it&#39;s a large, like the large amount of the issue. And don&#39;t get me wrong, like there are definitely very harmful incidents that happen to women that are like actively negative, right? And I won&#39;t try to deny those, but I would say that like the largest portion of the attrition and my eyes comes literally just from like, you can call it, lack of support, lack of like empowerment, whatever.

**AW:**         But it&#39;s just imagine like if it&#39;s, if it&#39;s like a race or like a, a path or whatever you want to call it and men are being like slightly tapped up words like the entire time and women just aren&#39;t, then there&#39;s going to, there&#39;s going to be this divide that happens. And then of course like all Duke students we&#39;re always comparing ourselves to people around us in terms of like thinking about how you do this, right? Like in terms of thinking about how capable or like basically whether or not we&#39;re inferior or if we fit in. And I think both of those things. Um, I mean it&#39;s not as if like women would only compare themselves to other women, right? Like they obviously would compare themselves to all their peers and when they see a lot of other peers ahead of them, that can be truly demoralizing, it can be otherizing and can be marginalizing. I mean it&#39;s just, it&#39;s very, um, and I&#39;ll be honest like I wish I had thought about this more at like a very specific level because I think like the practical implementation of this, like I can&#39;t immediately tell you. I think part of my answer or the reason why it&#39;s this blanket, like &quot;it&#39;s not something that&#39;s happening, it&#39;s just something that&#39;s not happening&quot; is because I honestly couldn&#39;t tell you the link specific active things because I haven&#39;t been looking for it.

**Michelle Chen:**         Like do you feel, I mean this is just my curiosity, but do you feel like it&#39;s a different experience working with like females versus males? Do they act differently? Do they work with you differently? Do they like ask you more questions?

**AW:**         Oh, definitely not. No, not in that sense. And like I know this isn&#39;t exactly what you&#39;re asking about. Like one like tangible way this could be done like this can be compared is like if you were working long distance with someone, right and you never saw them in person and they had like a gender ambiguous name. Could you tell? Probably not. I think it&#39;d be really interesting to ask Shelley Vohr about this because I think Shelley&#39;s, so shelley works for github and works remote and I think her slack handle is like a username. It&#39;s not &quot;Shelley&quot;. So I&#39;d be really curious to see because she effectively gets to have a gender blind software engineering experience or like something close to it, you know, that&#39;d be something like-- I&#39;m sure that people actually worked with her, you know, know her gender, that sort of thing. But in my experience I think there&#39;s something noticeable, which is I guess good and bad, right? Like good that I&#39;m not noticing things, but bad probably because there&#39;s like some implicit biases I don&#39;t even notice. Um, I&#39;m more treating your question to think about like do I have to like do like feel like I have to act any differently than I do? Do I feel have to treat them any differently? And I feel like, hm.

**AW:**         So like my, my, my initial reaction would be like if I put on my, like attempting to like, like if I put on my identity issues or like gender equity hat, then yes, I think so, right. Like I have worked in groups with women before where I actively tell them to not apologize, but I&#39;d be curious I guess to think about how even the way I do that is harmful, you know, like I think I&#39;ve learned a lot because of a couple of women, who I&#39;ve been lucky enough to work who have had the patience to like help me learn how to be better at learning about these issues, which is like really nice. Yeah, I don&#39;t think I see them any differently.

**Michelle Chen:**         So I guess the motivation behind this question is sort of like, I just feel like guys in compsci are so confident. Like they&#39;re very, they think that, not that they can do no wrong, but they&#39;re just like. So--even if they have no idea what they&#39;re talking about, they&#39;re like very, very confident in everythin that they say. Like when I, when I worked with women, a lot of times they&#39;re like, oh, like I&#39;m not sure, I don&#39;t know. And so I guess I was sort of looking at it from that perspective in which like, I feel like gender does impact experiences here.

**AW:**         Definitely, but I don&#39;t know how much of that comes from the way men see, well sorry. I don&#39;t know how much of that in the individual interaction where I&#39;m like, &quot;Hey Michelle, what are you thinking about this?&quot; And you&#39;re like, &quot;oh, I don&#39;t know&quot;. Like I don&#39;t know how much of that comes from either one party thinking the other party in a different way. Right. I think that&#39;s like definitely something that is enforced by gender dynamics that uh, that might men help perpetuate. But I don&#39;t know if like in the moment it&#39;s like a-- I don&#39;t know if in the moment I could do something differently that would not making you a response.

**Michelle Chen:**         Right.  That makes sense. I mean, so then does gender influence how you see teammates at all? Or is it just really just you&#39;re like--

**AW:**         Ah, yeah, hm. I don&#39;t think so. I mean I&#39;m trying to like find, think of like the textbook problematic examples and then switch up like a woman out for a male in my mind and see if I would think of them any differently. And... I mean, so if you&#39;re asking about like actively, do I think anything differently? No, I don&#39;t. I&#39;d be more curious to see like if because of like indirectly are the second order effective you know someone who apologizes for like doubts themselves more if I treat them a certain way. Right. And I&#39;d also say that like, yeah, confidence is an interesting thing, right? Because I think it&#39;s like even when they&#39;re like ignorant or like blindly confident they&#39;re competent and I&#39;m not going to say if it&#39;s better or worse, I think it&#39;s worse but I don&#39;t actually know. But I think I think this confidence is good or bad. I&#39;m leaning towards bad and I&#39;m not sure, but I think a lot of the confidence men have comes from-- or relative difference in confidence men have-- comes from always being supported and number having to doubt themselves, which is shitty, but also makes me wonder like, like if the net effect is women ended up messing up, or men end up--the net effect is men end up messing up more than women because of that like blind confidence. Right? And the question for me would be to then say, well obviously no, I&#39;m not a proponent of life women, shouldn&#39;t be confident, but it&#39;s more of how can you reframe like, I don&#39;t know, I think the ideal would be like in compsci, everyone second guesses--not second guesses but like everyone checks everyone else. Um, but in a non-negative way, right? Because like what you&#39;re talking about, of like, you know, a woman frequently being like, I don&#39;t know, like I want to double check with someone. Like that&#39;s couched in ultimately like some feeling of probably some like insecurity and like that&#39;s not good, but like the functional outcome of people now check, like have the to need to check their work I think is good. And that may be the result of that. Maybe the reason why women ended up being, I would very much not be surprised if women are actually like-- if there was a way to measure like how many mistakes they made, women probably make less mistakes than men. But like right now that happens because of a really shitty reason that is couched in insecurity and the ideal world would be--I&#39;d like that to like the ideal world would be, You have the error checking, you don&#39;t have the insecurity and then that goes across the board. So like men are overly confident but don&#39;t check their errors and that ideally that would be like a cautious optimism as well.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, I guess so talking about other identity factors, how do you think your race or socioeconomic status or any other identity factor besides gender has impacted your CS experience?

**AW:**         Um, so I think the first thing that comes to mind for SES is that a lot of people pursue computer science because it&#39;s lucrative and that comes with certain benefits or negative externalities. But just like that comes with certain differences in mindset than mine because I&#39;m lucky that while my parents would say like, you need to pursue something that will support you, I&#39;ve never felt-- I come from like a athletic background, so I never had to feel that urgency and I think that&#39;s given me definitely a lot of privilege in the sense that I don&#39;t have to worry about it as like a, I have to do this because it will make me money in the same way that like, I also don&#39;t have to worry about like being a consultant or being a banker to make money. Right. All right, I guess what I mean by that is like, I think it makes a difference but it doesn&#39;t make a difference so much in the fact that I&#39;ve chosen compsci.

**AW:**         But like, once I&#39;m in it, like how I think about it, like how, how much urgency there is. Um, and then as far as race goes, not really, but maybe that&#39;s just because I think maybe that&#39;s because I&#39;m a PM. And so I think of it as like, I suppose if I like have subconsciously bought into the uh, Asian awkward programmer, like male, Asian male, awkward, like socially awkward programmer stereotype. Like I feel like that doesn&#39;t apply to me both in terms of my actual occupation because I don&#39;t have the job of a programmer, but also like that&#39;s not how I see myself. I would consider to be like I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t see myself as socially awkward. So like those things also I think afford me a certain amount of confidence in how I interact in the tech world.

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you feel as if a community in which you feel welcome in the Duke CS department?

**AW:**         Uh no,  but also like I&#39;ve really never wanted to interact with the Duke CS department.

**Michelle Chen:**         Why?

**AW:**         I don&#39;t know. I think at first like freshman, sophomore year it was-- they&#39;re all about theory and I just want to code so they can&#39;t help me. And then junior, senior year it was &#39;I&#39;m going to do PM and they don&#39;t know anything about that&#39;. Um, what was the question? Do I feel supported? Or do I think I have a community in which I feel welcomed? Oh, OK. Well like, yes. I&#39;m sure I would be welcomed, but I have never engaged with that. Like I never really never interacted with any, any part of the comp sci department like socially. Yeah, like yes I TA&#39;d but like, like let&#39;s eat pizza and grade and that sort of thing, like I think I had a little bit of like the, like the analogous term would be like internalized racism except like internalized, like programmer phobia or whatever of like seeing the stereotype of the awkward, like socially awkward asian nerd programmer and being like, I don&#39;t want to be a part of that. So I just surrounded myself with socially and like I found community in people that just weren&#39;t that.

**AW:**         And I have no problem with that. But I think to the original question, yes there is a community. So I should be clear. Yes, there&#39;s a community where I would feel welcome, just not--

**Michelle Chen:**         But you don&#39;t want to be a part of it because you don&#39;t want to be seen as a stereotype?

**AW:**         I think at first I was the reason and then after awhile, I mean now like intellectually now, no, that&#39;s not why. I just have friends elsewhere. Right. Like, I don&#39;t see any value--like if the value if the value proposition is like community, friends, networking, professional mentorship, academic mentorship, like I&#39;ve gotten all those things through things that aren&#39;t the department. Right? It&#39;s like HackDuke, professors. Like I&#39;m good friends with Alex Hardiming on a one to one basis. Like, there&#39;s my, like academic, I suppose if I ever needed something there. Um, I never particularly been interested in research or I&#39;ve never been involved in it. So I&#39;ve never had a need for that. So yeah, I&#39;d say probably at the beginning there was a little bit of like internalized, like distancing from a stereotype and now I mean now I have no problem with them, but I just don&#39;t just don&#39;t need it. I already have time, like spent the time everywhere else.

**Michelle Chen:**         In terms of specific classes, like when I say 308, 310, 330, like what, what do you think of when you think of those three classes?

**AW:**         308, everyone says it&#39;s hard. I found it very easy. I think the reason why I found it easy was one, like how all the social privileges stacked up for me. Namely like, like I always felt supported right. And then in terms of in actuality, I also happen to enjoy just like coding in Java and then the next layer down was I saw it as ultimately like a class in like teamwork and team dynamics and working on software projects as a team. And so what I have told every underclassmen asking me about that class since is for me, I saw the way to do well in that class as to um, collaborate well, figure out what people&#39;s strengths and weaknesses are and try to optimize for strengths and like having that planning conversation at the beginning and understanding when people are busy and not busy and understanding when someone&#39;s going out of town for like some event, um, that was something that I thought it was kinda like came relatively natural to me.

**AW:**         And so then what I did have to do, like, you know, I did, yes, I like pulled like two, 10 hour days like for each of the projects. But it was fun and I also think I was only taking four courses and I had the like patience and availability to work on them. So yeah, I mean it was fun and yeah, I don&#39;t think I got that much out of the course in terms of like the technical concepts I like to do kind of regret that because I think a lot of the articles that Duvall shared, I just didn&#39;t read. That talked about a lot of like software like programming concepts like very, very thoroughly, right, so talking about things like good scoping or like MVC or like proper ways to do extractions or like serialization or reflection of like these are all concepts I could have learned and like the ones when I did interact with them it was literally just through like I didn&#39;t want to read the articles. I just looked at examples and kind of understood it intuitively. So that&#39;s a bit different. 330 I went in accepting what I was going to get a B, I kind of PAID attention in class, but not really because it seemed kind of hopeless. I went to the TA, got like help on the homework, turned in every homework, like scored exactly average on the exam. Got a B, like had no, I had no problems with that going in. I think the thing about algorithms, and I don&#39;t blame the professor, he was a great professor, but the concepts are also modular. They don&#39;t really stack on each other and they&#39;re all like so unintuitive that it&#39;s very hard for I think someone who hasn&#39;t--

**AW:**         Like he way I kind of think about it, it&#39;s like given a set of problems like, like algorithms problems, right? I think you just have to see a lot of them before you can like start to recognize any of them, right? It&#39;s not like, oh, like graph traversals-- I need to see like three graph traversal problems before, you know, I can do graphs traversal. Because I think that was the approach the homework set us up for it and I think in reality it&#39;s like you need to take algorithms like three times as a course and then you can do any of the problems probably fine, but your just--brain just won&#39;t get into that like analytical problem solving, you know, like how can I pull these algorithms apart and think of them a series of step? I just don&#39;t think you can accomplish that in one semester. I also took--I took 330 after 260, which I think um, because we, a professor Hardiming taught us a lot of algorithms in 260, I think actually gave me a huge leg up when the content didn&#39;t overlap. So like dynamic programming for me it was very easy because we learned dynamic programming like with a one dimensional dynamic program like DP table and we did that problem by paper both in the homework and the exams. And in Professor Hardiming&#39;s class we implemented a three-dimensional is one dynamic programming table. Right? So like being able to do that, I think it was super beneficial but only for that specific problem. Like that didn&#39;t help me with anything else even though I&#39;d taken that course. 310, super interesting, wish I paid attention-- like wish I made it to class more. But the lectures were very interesting and same thing with 250--it was all very interesting because there&#39;s not, there&#39;s not too much intuition required. It just like, you just learn how it works and that&#39;s just how it works. And then I think I really enjoyed thinking about like reordering of the locks and the conditional variables because I think that was a part where it wasn&#39;t just this like formulaic thing like the processor in 250. It was actually kind of like intuitive about like, yeah, like the ordering. I thought that was pretty cool. Um, but otherwise it was very much just this is how it works, do it.

**AW:**         Did you think it was hard to for help in any of those classes?

**Michelle Chen:**         Uh, no.

**AW:**         And how could any of them have been better beyond what you told me? Or--or do you think they&#39;re fine as they are?

**AW:**         I mean they probably could have taught less in 330. Less breath, more depth. I still think 330, would not have accomplished what it tries to accomplish. I just don&#39;t think you can do it a semester for most people, which is like, I don&#39;t know, algorithms well, but if you really want people to have like a good understanding of algorithms, they have to do it for a long time and like the reason why I say less breadth, like fewer algorithms, it&#39;s just so you can practice more with those specific examples and even then that will not be applicable outside of those examples, but I mean at least like this is a little bit of a crude abstraction, but it&#39;s like at least you can know like five algorithms well enough to like do problems that are very slight tweaks on those five algorithms. It&#39;s not going to help you with anything else, but.. And then 310 was fine. 330, I mean, sorry 308, Oh, well, the thing about 308, my perception of it was like the code was almost irrelevant. What you, what you actually wrote. It was entirely in the write up, which is also probably a large part of why I had so much fun with it because like for the code, I just wanted things I want--well no, that&#39;s not fair. I think it was, I was very lucky that some of the stuff was easier for me and then on top of that I just had fun with it. So like for the second and third projects I did front end and I had a ton of fun just like making all the buttons resize dynamically resize as I resized the size of the window and then the writing part I wrote about things completely unrelated to that and I probably spent like an hour on total and I made it sound nice and I got an A.

**AW:**         So that was kind of frustrating because I think depending on what Duvall is going for, um, like yeah. I actually respect the guy a ton. I think what he&#39;s doing is like often criticized but like hard, right? Because like it&#39;s kind of like, it&#39;s an inherently, like-- software engineering or development is inherently like this, like alinear amorphous, like multifaceted topic. But I think it would&#39;ve been nice if we had tried to focus on one specific set of things and then like optimize all of that. Right. So for example, the, the course is about software design. I say the most important thing you get out, like what I thought was most important to doing well in the class was teamwork skills. What I think-- sorry. What I thought was most important to having a good time and not having like, like having a healthy and good time in the class was teamwork skills.

**AW:**         What I say is most important to getting an A in the class, is what you write in the write up and the actual content of the class, and the software, the code you write itself is almost irrelevant to either of those two things. Like those things should be aligned, right? Whatever the course is. And so if you decide that your goal is like teamwork, then like you write-- you write about that and be like you have to like delegate who writes code in a way that optimizes for teamwork and you like give challenging assignments that require like a lot of communication over like relatively complex pieces of code that aren&#39;t like crazy big. And that&#39;s how you get a class about like teamwork and software design. And if you do the same thing about like teaching people different paradigms, then you don&#39;t give them four projects and give them a dozen articles, blog posts a week and like lecture about these concepts. You actually lecture about concepts that are useful in your assessments and your projects. The consistency there is really important for me.

**Michelle Chen:**         I agree with you. What could the CS department do better? This is my last one. You can really say anything because I&#39;m basically just gonna slap these in a list and be like, here&#39;s things that I think that you guys could do better. Or do you have any qualms with the department and anything that you wish--

**AW:**         So I don&#39;t think I engage with the department specifically enough to learn about a lot of specific problems. I think a lot of people are frustrated that Duke CS is heavy on theory and light on like practical skills. I think that&#39;s true, but like we have Lynda and we have code academy and a lot of that stuff is really hard to teach in a classroom, so I don&#39;t blame them too much for it. I also understand that like professors do research and that&#39;s more interesting. I think the biggest qualm is I think we need--so if 101 and 201 are going to be our intro courses, they need to be taught by the same people every semester. Those same people need to spend a lot of time and have a lot of resources to creating a really good experience and that needs to be like the sole priority of the department until that&#39;s done.  Right. So I look at CS50 at Harvard and Yale. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re familiar with those--

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah yeah yeah.

**AW:**         Yeah, the ones you can find on youtube and I think like this, the importance of this is on so many levels. Um, or like the implementation, like where this needs to happen in so many levels, the importance of it is just: one, you give people a good foundation to like learn things from and two, you don&#39;t burn people out early on. And if I had to break it up, I would say it&#39;s in--the first area where this is important is like resource allocation. So like there needs to be enough cs 201 TAs where people don&#39;t feel like office hours are useless because of office hours are useless, then they feel hopeless and they just don&#39;t do it anymore. Right? Next, as far as curriculum design, like I think CS201 curriculum is taught in a different order every semester.  I think it&#39;s just kind of based on what people feel is the-- or whatever the three or four professors that teach it feels appropriate for that semester and I TA&#39;d for four, three, four semesters of CS201 and it was just like a complete nightmare each time because it was taught to complete differently you know, there were professors that were using um, trees in an assignment before they taught trees and expecting students to not have questions about that. And I think, I mean, you can kind of think of it as like dependency management, right? Let&#39;s minimize the number of dependencies, number of unlearned dependencies that people need at any time and their 201 process and maybe 101. I didn&#39;t take 101, so I don&#39;t know. Um, and I realize that is an incredibly hard problem, right? Like, it&#39;s, I mean like honestly you could probably do some graph theory to figure out what&#39;s the best way to minimize dependencies, right?

**AW:**         Like I think and, and, and, and, and, and, and you can only minimize dependencies to a certain point, but then I think the way to mitigate after that is understanding when a concept is like really hard to define because you haven&#39;t taught the dependencies yet. And then like really putting a lot of into how you can teach every basic concept so that they have just enough to understand or like, like let&#39;s say you&#39;re teaching about sets in Java but you haven&#39;t taught about--haven&#39;t talked about classes yet, right? Like one that&#39;s kind of dumb, two that&#39;s basically what happened in 201, and then three, I&#39;m not saying teach them about classes before you can teach them how to use the tree set class or whatever, but give them enough understanding of it so they can use tree sets. Actually sit down for like 20 minutes and think about like, OK, I&#39;ve never done Java before and my first day&#39;s lecture uses a tree set. Like how the hell am I gonna figure out what this thing is? What is the minimum amount of knowledge I need to understand that? And then package that in there and then go from there. And yes, that will result in like a little bit of redundancy and yes, that&#39;ll make, make things go slower, but like that&#39;s what your students deserve. Like otherwise it&#39;s just so... It&#39;s horrible. Um, and then on that note, just I think the idea that students were supposed to show up in 201 having had 101 experience and like understand Java, they&#39;re given no Java instruction like actual Java instruction and yes I understand that like the courses about concepts and Java syntax is like maybe below a professor or like not something that they should spend the time teaching, but like the amount of times I taught people like what a main method is and how to write a class... Like I think every single semester that TA&#39;d, like that was like my first lesson right. Where like I didn&#39;t really just like did not pay attention to what the professor had given me for the first, like four or five weeks because it was just useless because people had so many questions that I had by that time  figured out like a good four or five week curriculum of how to answer the questions that they&#39;re probably having this time of year and to do so. Right. And I don&#39;t know, like I, I still do like cs 201 review sessions before finals for like friends that I meet in like ASA or something. And like last semester I had to explain to someone what the difference between like private public and protected is, which is like, it&#39;s literally the first word you write when you code in Java and like how did people not know that? Like that kind of stuff.

**AW:**         And this is not like easy. I&#39;m not saying they should, that they should have done this all along. But like take your head out of the clouds, sit down with, with literally with students, or like put yourself in their shoes and think about what they do and don&#39;t know and redesign the curriculum so that people aren&#39;t left trying to, you know, like build some big concept off of really, really shaky foundations. Because otherwise you&#39;re just setting up people up for a bad time throughout the rest of their CS career. Um, or, or if it&#39;s the current intention to be a weed out, then keep it exactly the way it is because what CS201 does right now it weed outs anyone who does not find this stuff intuitive. Like maybe not that they won&#39;t, they don&#39;t fail, but I don&#39;t know. Like the amount of times I&#39;ve seen people like writing 10, four loops for an array--sorry, 10 like statements for an array that&#39;s 10, like that&#39;s 10 long. Right? Like, that&#39;s just like, if you don&#39;t get that intuitively, then you&#39;re not gonna understand that. And if Duke is saying compsci isn&#39;t right for you, then that&#39;s fine. I mean that&#39;s our way of like getting rid of those people. But if that&#39;s the case, 201 should be harder. But if it&#39;s not a weed out class, then you have to like take, I think. I think the biggest, the biggest directive I would give is... Imagine you&#39;re teaching this, imagine every concept is not intuitive to your student. How would you teach it? And go one by one like that?

**AW:**         Yeah. It was kind of a mess. I feel bad for everyone taking 201.

**Michelle Chen:**         I, you know, it&#39;s interesting because I feel like 201&#39;s not a weed out class. I feel like people are more discouraged by like 250, or at least I was because I after I took it, I was like I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing. That&#39;s interesting that you--I TA&#39;d 201 for one semester

**AW:**         Well I mean that logic applies, but like 201 is just earlier in the pipeline, right? So they can both be weedout classes.

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you have a lot of friends who ended up dropping?

**AW:**         No that&#39;s why I say that if it was actually a weed-out class, it doesn&#39;t do that good of a job of weeding people out, right? But like I guess the way that it has been constructed leads me to think it looks like a weed out class and they way both prevent it from being a weed out class and prevent it from being problematic for all those reasons is to think about redesigning the curriculum or evaluating each case on the curriculum as if the students were to find it extremely un-intuitive, and how would you teach it based on that? Right.

**Michelle Chen:**         Interesting.

**AW:**         And that does also mean like finding-- mean, and when I say get your head out of the clouds, I don&#39;t mean that in a derogatory way, but like if I code in Java, right, learning how to teach people who don&#39;t know Java, it&#39;s going to be really hard unless I either practice or go talk to someone who doesn&#39;t know, like, yeah, you have to go, you have to be around people that don&#39;t know Java to learn how to teach beginners Java.

**Michelle Chen:**         Thank you. Do you think there&#39;s anyone else that&#39;d be good to interview?  Um, or anyone you can think of? I&#39;m just trying to get a lot of experiences.

**AW:**         Jeremy Fox, he graduated last year.

**Michelle Chen:**         Oh, I know him.

**AW:**         He was in HackDuke for a while. almost wrote a book on like a medium guide, a guide to like dude comp sci. And then he ran out of time before he graduated. He has a lot of thoughts. And then Shelley probably just because like-- did you already talk to her?

**Michelle Chen:**         I have her.  Well I, I&#39;m going, I&#39;m going to interview her. Any, anything else you want to say?

**AW:**         I think it&#39;s great that you&#39;re doing this.

**Michelle Chen:**         Thank you. Also Astrachan&#39;s my professor so he&#39;ll be, he&#39;ll be the one reading. I don&#39;t know if that changes anything for you.

**AW:**         No, no. I&#39;ve never had Astrachan, um, I mean I don&#39;t want to be too harsh on the 201 professors because I, I, I&#39;ve only ever had the privilege of teaching like basically a dozen people that don&#39;t get it at a time and any like heuristics I have on how I can teach a dozen people, like with each additional person gets, gets exponentially more complicated. Right. So like, you know, I only see the bad, like I always have the people that doesn&#39;t work  for and that&#39;s my opinion is informed by that.

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you think that they&#39;re going to think that it&#39;s going to be too easy for some people if they change it? Too easy for the people at the top of the class.

**AW:**         Yeah. But that&#39;s, that&#39;s-- if they have a problem with that and they need to come to terms with what that means and like be OK with that in a teaching philosophy, right? And I guess that&#39;s what I mean, like I&#39;m not, I don&#39;t, I don&#39;t mean that in too like accusative of a way, but like it&#39;s like are you teaching for the bottom or the top? Are you trying to push the bottom up or push the top forward? Because a class like 201 I would argue is not there to push the top forward. Like that&#39;s for like, like if you want that to be the concern, let people skip 230 and go straight to 3:30. Right? Or something like that. Because I&#39;ve taken combinatorics and I can do like 9 choose 3 on a ti 84 calculator. So I don&#39;t need to be in you know, like CS230. I don&#39;t know.

**Michelle Chen:**         Thank you. I&#39;m gonna stop the recording.

<details><summary>Interviewee - JL </summary>
<p>
**Michelle Chen:**         Right? And I&#39;m kind of like, I just think that it&#39;ll be nice because I don&#39;t have to do this. Like I don&#39;t know how to make a website like

**JL:**         Okay, me either... If it makes you feel better that you don&#39;t.

**Michelle Chen:**         I have no idea. Yeah, no, I have no idea how to make a website. And so um yeah, it&#39;s fine. But I was just, I went to him and I was like, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing. And then he was kind of like, well you still have to make a website. And then I was like, what if I did this instead and he was like, okay, like that&#39;s fine.

**JL:**         This is a good idea though because I feel like it is pretty...

**Michelle Chen:**         There&#39;s a lot of things that I think the department could change and I just like, I think everyone&#39;s had very different experiences and I&#39;ve done like a few of these so far and everyone has different ideas of what they want changed. Um, so I guess the first question is, what year are you at Duke?

**JL:**         Junior.

**Michelle Chen:**         And then 308, 310, and 330. Which of those have you taken or are you in them?

**JL:**         None of them but I&#39;m taking 310 next semester.

**Michelle Chen:**         You&#39;re taking 310 next semester. Um, and then did you have any compsci education prior to Duke?

**JL:**         No, I did not know what compsci was before I came here.

**Michelle Chen:**         And so like do you, did your family and friends encourage you to study CS or like how did you decide you want to do compsi?

**JL:**         Um, I did like a bunch of, I took like econ, I took took stats because that&#39;s what I wanted to originally and like I hated both those so much that I was like, I knew obviously a bunch of people that were in 101 so I ended up just taking that to see what it was like and loved it so much, like so so much. And then from there, like went abroad and they didn&#39;t have 201 abroad. So I kinda like declared my major after only taking 101 so I was a little freaked out by it, but it ended up being fine.

**Michelle Chen:**         Um, let&#39;s see. So who do you surround yourself with in your classes and in group work in compsci?

**JL:**         Um, well this semester I&#39;m in three compsci classes and Austin is in all three of them with me too and we like somehow, we didn&#39;t even talk about this beforehand and we&#39;re in the same lab too, like never even spoke about it. So I do like literally all of my work with him. And then Julia Ross is in two of my classes too so I do it with her sometimes like I live in office hours.

**Michelle Chen:**         So is there, do you feel like it was like, I guess the next question is like why do you think you&#39;ve chosen those individuals to surround yourself with?

**JL:**         Um I think like Austin I have very similar work ethics and we keep each other motivated and like are like willing to work on the same level. Like I tried working with like another girl before and it was just like--

**Michelle Chen:**         Wait, what do you mean when same level--  like, you both are really motivated or like--

**JL:**         I feel like we work well together and like we&#39;re good at like talking things out until we like understand it and like aren&#39;t afraid ask each other questions or like, sound stupid.

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you feel like--cause-- so it&#39;s interesting because I feel like every, most of the guys that I work with and compsci like super, like know it all and like very like confident. So like it&#39;s interesting-- but you don&#39;t feel like Austin is like--

**JL:**         Not really.

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you think he feels like you do just like, he&#39;s like, &#39;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on&#39;

**JL:**         Yeah, and that&#39;s like we&#39;re on the very same like compsci intellectual level, which is why it works well. So like I know like Adam Davidovich, he&#39;s like insanely good at it and I don&#39;t want to work with him because like Austin will work with him sometimes and he&#39;s like &#39;yeah Adam finished all of this so fast like I felt so stupid&#39;. You know, like yeah, I don&#39;t want to do that.

**Michelle Chen:**         So you would rather work with someone that you feel like it&#39;s on your level?

**JL:**         Yeah,

**Michelle Chen:**         Because that&#39;s also interesting. I feel the same way, but someone I talked to was like, no, you have to, you have to work with someone smarter than you so that they&#39;ll give you answers. And I was like, but I don&#39;t want them to know like how dumb I am. So okay, that makes sense.

**JL:**         I definitely feel that.

**Michelle Chen:**         And do you think your experience in the CS major has been different than most male student&#39;s experiences? And if so how?

**JL:**         Um, maybe? I don&#39;t really know because I don&#39;t like talk to them that much about it. Um, I definitely--ugh, don&#39;t know. It&#39;s tricky.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, I, I get that.

**JL:**         Like all my, like TAs and stuff, were usually guys so, and they&#39;re like geniuses obviously.

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you feel like intimidated when you talk to them or like are you more just like, I know I&#39;m here, they know I&#39;m here for help.

**JL:**         Like yeah, like to an extent it&#39;s a little intimidating and like I just don&#39;t want to be to be annoying and like ask them a million questions and I do want to like figure it out on my own as well. But like I still go to like everyone&#39;s office hours and like, do ask, and I have a tutor for 2:50 as well.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, I mean it&#39;s just so weird because like I just feel like guys ask dumb questions and people are like, oh, it&#39;s whatever. But if a girl asks it, it&#39;s like, oh this dumb girl in compsci. I don&#39;t know, maybe that&#39;s just my experience.

**JL:**         No, I do feel like that&#39;s sometimes, I mean it&#39;s easy to feel dumb in compsci. Like, so easy. Like I do feel dumb a lot but I always somehow like end up figuring it out and then it&#39;s rewarding and then I just do it all over again. So it&#39;s like a  constant cycle.

**Michelle Chen:**         Um, let&#39;s see. So I guess this is sort of a follow up question, but in what ways has your gender impacted your experience as a CS major, or has it?

**JL:**         I don&#39;t think it has a ton. Like I don&#39;t really think about it that much and like I&#39;ve actually done research on like women computer science, like an education class I took and it was interesting reading about those because like the things that I was reading about, like I never thought about like, like girls saying that they felt super stupid or like were the only girl in their class and none of the male students wanted to help them. Like they felt dumb asking questions or patronized.  Like, I never like thought about that being me until like I read all of them and was like oh, I can see how that would happen, but I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s like as bad for me as it was for like the ones that I&#39;ve about.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, so I like. What did you learn in that research? Like what was the--or just can you tell me a little bit?

**JL:**         Yeah. Was like a lot about how like compsci education can be better for women and just offer more like resources, like undergraduate females that like they can go and talk to like TAs and stuff and like um like talking about like women&#39;s accomplishments in computer science in classes to like say see this person is a woman, she went to Duke or whatever and she&#39;s super successful and like very respected.

**Michelle Chen:**         Do they have other ideas for how to make it better? Because I&#39;m like, it&#39;s hard. I feel like it&#39;s a hard problem to solve.

**JL:**         Yeah. I can send you my paper that I wrote for it.

**Michelle Chen:**         Can you actually?

**JL:**         It was like really interesting doing research on it too. Um like, I&#39;m part of like rewriting the code which is like the imposter syndrome I think is like the realest thing ever, especially in compsci. So I feel like, like I feel like I&#39;m going to graduate and like not know how to do anything

**Michelle Chen:**         Ok like that hits so close. So obviously I&#39;m what--leaving in like a week and a half or like graduating so soon and I feel like I&#39;m going to leave and like not have gained any tangible skills. Like I sometimes I&#39;m just like, I don&#39;t know what I learned in compsci and it&#39;s kind of like

**JL:**         That&#39;s kind of how I&#39;ve been feeling.

**Michelle Chen:**         You know what I mean?

**JL:**         It&#39;s like so hard to and you&#39;re just like--

**Michelle Chen:**         And even after that, especially in 250, like after I would accomplish something I&#39;d be like, well it&#39;s mostly the TAs that did that. I like or like you know what? I would always be like, I got so much help that I don&#39;t know if it even counts as like my accomplishment.

**JL:**         I feel that. That&#39;s funny that you say like, I think of you as this like insanely amazing like compsci genius. Like that is what I think of when I think and I&#39;m like, I wish I could be like Michelle Chen

**Michelle Chen:**         But I literally am like, so-- I don&#39;t know. I also think it&#39;s like very easy-- well you&#39;ve never worked with me so you had no idea. I ask so many questions. I feel like I never know what&#39;s going on. I feel so dumb.

**JL:**         That&#39;s how you learn.

**Michelle Chen:**         I know, but I just like, I think it might be because of like I did hackduke so people are like, oh, like you must be really good at compsci, but then they work with me and they&#39;re like, oh, no. But like, I don&#39;t know, I just, it&#39;s, I&#39;m definitely not, and like when you say you&#39;re worried you&#39;re going to graduate. Like I literally feel that all the time. I&#39;m like I&#39;ve taken all the core classes and I really don&#39;t know what I learned.  Like if you asked me to like build a processor right now I would be like, I like, I have no, like I don&#39;t even remember. I don&#39;t know, maybe I just have bad memory, but like

**JL:**         I feel like that&#39;s for like every class, you know, what do you actually learn?

**Michelle Chen:**         That&#39;s true. That&#39;s fair.

**JL:**         People are like, you mostly learn on the job for what like relevant things and this is just background stuff so you&#39;re not like totally lost

**Michelle Chen:**         And I guess do you want to do like software engineering or like--oh! I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve ever told you this story. This was also part of the motivation. So like I took 308 and I was in a group project with four other guys. It was like a, the professor like made the groups. Anyway, this one guy a year older than me, like called himself like the project manager the first day and he would delete my code and he would like force push over my code on github and then he like told me that like I was like a waste of his time. And like, yeah, I took it also like right after I took 201 and he was like, I like asked him a question once about his code and he was like, I just want you to know like I have so many other better things to be doing right now than like answering your questions, he&#39;s like, you don&#39;t know what good design is, like, he&#39;s like, you have no idea--

**JL:**         Oh my god. That&#39;s like why you&#39;re in the class...

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. And so like, I dunno, ever since then I was like really disillusioned. Like I just like,

**JL:**         I&#39;m so sorry.

**Michelle Chen:**         No, but I haven&#39;t like, it&#39;s, that&#39;s why I&#39;m saying like everyone has such different experiences and now he&#39;s going to go work at, he&#39;s working at Linkedin and I&#39;m just like, it sucks that I like, I feel like there are these classes-- Duke is graduating like these classes of people from computer science and they&#39;re honestly like some of them are objectively shitty people.

**Michelle Chen:**         Like they&#39;re just like. And I&#39;m like, sucks for whoever has to work with this guy. Like that&#39;s why I know I never want to be a part of the industry. But I don&#39;t know, people are always like, well you did so much with compsci. Like why wouldn&#39;t you want to do compsci after? And it was just kind of like, because I feel like I had some really bad experiences that like made me not like. I was like-- I just kept telling myself like what if I go into the real world and then like and my like partner, like just deletes my code, which like I don&#39;t know, that--

**JL:**         That&#39;s so bad.

**Michelle Chen:**         That&#39;s like part of it. But that&#39;s part of the reason why like I&#39;m trying to do this because I&#39;m trying to understand other people&#39;s experiences because I know that mine is like, not everyone had the same experience as me.

**Michelle Chen:**         Um, I guess. So sort of related is does gender influence how you see teammates? Like are you more inclined to try to work with girls or are you like I should work with guys because they&#39;re smarter and more competent?

**JL:**         I don&#39;t. I guess I don&#39;t really think about it that much. It&#39;s just because like I have friends in my classes, it&#39;s just like easier to just work with them

**Michelle Chen:**         And is Austin going to be in 310 as well with you?

**JL:**         I don&#39;t think is. He&#39;s doing the minor so I don&#39;t think he has to take 310. Yeah I&#39;m doing 310 and 316 and I don&#39;t know anyone else that&#39;s doing it. So it will be interesting to see. Like I didn&#39;t have any--I didn&#39;t know anyone when I took 201 And it was so terrible. Like so hard, like I was in office hours and they were so not helpful.

**Michelle Chen:**         Did you--so did you like try to team up with people or like work with other people?

**JL:**         Like in my lab there&#39;s like three people that I could kind of knew. So I ended up like-- we would do all the labs together and then I ended up working with one of the girls on a project, which was nice because, I don&#39;t know, like it was fun to work with like another girl, like yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         Because like I just feel like, I dunno, maybe it&#39;s different because I feel like I had to interact with a lot of people in compsci just by nature of doing hackDuke. And like I always just felt like guys were so-- like they just act like they know everything that they&#39;re talking about and if you&#39;d like try to interrogate them, it turns out they actually have no idea what they&#39;re talking about. Like I don&#39;t know.

**JL:**         Yeah, that&#39;s definitely annoying. And I I just feel like I kind of have to like step it up a little bit to like show them like I know what I&#39;m talking about like this versus like when you talk about it with girls, I just feel like it&#39;s like they&#39;re so supportive.

**Michelle Chen:**         Like the fact that I&#39;m telling you I don&#39;t know anything and you&#39;re like, oh, like I feel like if I told a guy that he&#39;d be like, yeah, like, I&#39;m not surprised, or like some like especially that one guy that I worked with. He just like it also, it was like my sophomore year, so that was how I viewed compsci after that.

**JL:**         Yeah, and that&#39;s when you&#39;re declaring your major and all of that.

**Michelle Chen:**         So anyway, I won&#39;t go on. But I guess, do you think any of your other identity factors like socioeconomic status or race have impacted your computer science experience here?

**JL:**         Um, me, I don&#39;t know, like I have a tutor so like obviously pay for that. So I guess like he&#39;s very helpful for 250. So like if I didn&#39;t have that, then I guess I&#39;d have to go to office hours more, which are harder.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, how so like how does that work?  I always wanted a tutor but I was always too lazy to figure it out.

**JL:**         Well Julia Ross, it&#39;s like her friend Quinn Thompson.

**Michelle Chen:**         Oh okay.

**JL:**         Um, so she was just like texted him and was like hey can you help us with the MIPS? And then he ended up helping us with that and it&#39;s just like I don&#39;t like have him help me for everything. I&#39;ve only met with him once but like now I&#39;m doing my cache and I&#39;m like so confused.

**Michelle Chen:**         You only met with him once? Oh. Well I guess that&#39;s not like a weekly thing.

**JL:**         I, yeah, it&#39;s just like when I am like really struggling, like actually have no idea. They usually like Austin and I can figure it out and Julia.

**Michelle Chen:**         It&#39;s just you and Austin just do literally everything?

**JL:**         Literally I spend so much time with him. It&#39;s ridiculous. But like I definitely I like need to work with other people.  Like if I like pull it up and try to start on my own, I&#39;m just like, I don&#39;t know where to start.

**Michelle Chen:**         But then in 201 didn&#39;t you say--you were like you didn&#39;t know anyone. So what did you do?

**JL:**         Like I hate that class so much. I&#39;d like go to office hours and sometimes wait for like three hours. One person would help me and they&#39;d look at it, fix one thing and then I&#39;d be like okay cool. And then I&#39;d have another question but like office hours would be over.

**Michelle Chen:**         Did you ever try to like work with other people in 201?

**JL:**         Like the labs were like pretty helpful. Yeah, I would ask the lab TAs or ask the people in my lab like when we had it, but that was also like hard. I didn&#39;t do super great in 201.

**Michelle Chen:**         I mean I just think it&#39;s hard if you don&#39;t know anyone to like sort of-- that&#39;s how I felt in 330. I was like,

**JL:**         I feel like you can&#39;t do well if you don&#39;t

**Michelle Chen:**         If you don&#39;t know people or ask people, which is like, it&#39;s tough because you don&#39;t. I don&#39;t know, I never wanted to come across as stupid, but I was also like, I need help. So it wasn&#39;t like, it wasn&#39;t even a pride thing. It was just like I don&#39;t know where to start or who to ask.

**JL:**         I definitely feel that.

**Michelle Chen:**         I just, yeah. Um, let&#39;s see. Do you feel as if there&#39;s a community in which you&#39;re welcome in the CS department at Duke?

**JL:**         Just like my computer science friends I guess

**Michelle Chen:**         But not like within the department or anything?

**JL:**         What do you mean? Like, just like an example. That&#39;s okay.

**Michelle Chen:**         So the, what I&#39;m trying to get at with this question is just like, I don&#39;t feel like there&#39;s a community of CS at Duke, like I really don&#39;t feel like I know, I don&#39;t know, like, you know, and I feel like engineers like BME have their, like, you know what I mean, like it seems like they have a community or even like, I don&#39;t know, like what, like poly sci, like they at least seem to have some central hub or like some way that they like all know that they&#39;re all polysci that like I feel like compsci, like I, there&#39;s no community. The department I feel like doesn&#39;t really do that much to try to make it like community. And so when I ask people, people are just like, I don&#39;t know..

**JL:**         I guess like an office hours, there&#39;s a lot of the same people. So like, and we&#39;ll like help each other out there. That&#39;s like probably the only example I would be able to think of of that.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. Um, and then, so I guess, can you talk about your specific experience into 250? Like how hard was it for you? How hard was it for you to ask for help and how can it be better?

**JL:**         So I&#39;m in that right now, so I&#39;m still working on it. The first--I think there&#39;s a really, really big learning curve. Like I still don&#39;t really understand C, so that was harder than MIPS honestly. But I like I spend a lot of time on my homework assignments, like I definitely dedicate a lot of time to it and I feel like by the end of it I like very much understand like everything I&#39;ve done which is good, but it takes me a long time to get there. Like definitely longer than most people, which is frustrating because it&#39;s sometimes I&#39;ll spend six hours during it and like have four lines of code and I&#39;m like eh... And then I thought like, well, and I had my tutor for MIPS, he was awesome and he just like helped me conceptualize like everything. He was like, okay, like these are the things that you need to do. And then I was like, okay, like I actually feel like I know how to do this. Um, and it was like crazy, like talking to him for like 10 minutes, I was like, wow, this just makes so much sense. I just needed that extra one on one help and then I didn&#39;t think like the, like the logism and stuff was like too challenging. Like it was like more annoying and tedious, but the slides are actually helpful for that, which is rare because usually they&#39;re not at all.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, that&#39;s true.

**JL:**         The processor was just blah. Did it, I started it so late. I did it in three days and then ended up deleting the whole thing and starting it again like six hours before it was due because nothing worked. But I ended up getting the whole thing to work and like I definitely understood it and I was like, okay, this is fine. But it took me--like I skipped all my classes and only worked on it for like hours and hours.

**Michelle Chen:**         That sounds like compsci.  What I hate is like, it&#39;s not like, you know when you write a paper you&#39;re kind of like, okay, I know like if I spend like this, I need the outline, blah blah-- with compsci it&#39;s like you could be done if maybe it&#39;s a good day and you&#39;re done in two hours or maybe it takes you two weeks. Like genuinely like you have no idea. That&#39;s the most. I think that was because I can, I can never budget my time correctly with compsci. I could never plan because I&#39;d be like, well it could be two hours or it could be two days.

**JL:**         I really feel that so hard because I waste so much time. I feel like. And if you just get stuck, there&#39;s nothing you can do until you can ask for help. And that&#39;s why I think it&#39;s good to work with other people. It&#39;s like you can only think about it one way and then they can give you another perspective.

**Michelle Chen:**         I guess, so then like how do you think your experience in 250 could have been better?

**JL:**         Maybe just like having more like one on one help. So like just more resources. Yeah, it&#39;s just like explaining what needs to be done because sometimes it&#39;s just like confusing where to start, what exactly needs to be done. I actually have like really, really good lab TAs like they&#39;re awesome and they like show us how to do everything for the labs and then like hold office hours for us. So I think that was huge.

**Michelle Chen:**         Like, like special for just for your section?

**JL:**         Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         Who are your TAs?

**JL:**         Alex and Joseph. I can give you their last names.

**Michelle Chen:**         No it&#39;s fine. I was just wondering if I knew them but they&#39;re just like they were really great which I think helped a lot too and they would like explain everything and like tell you like things to look out for and where to start. And I think that was like--because I don&#39;t think 250 is that bad. I really like it.

**Michelle Chen:**         You liked 250?

**JL:**         Yeah, so I think it&#39;s probably because of my experience.

**Michelle Chen:**         So then I guess because I feel like you have a lot of opinions about 201.

**JL:**         Oh my god. I hated 201.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, so like how, how do you think that it could be better? Like what are things that the department could do because I know that there&#39;s a lot of things.

**JL:**         So many things. So um, I think making the labs like actually relevant to the homework, like kind of like starting, I think they should like start the homeworks off in the labs so you know what the hell you&#39;re doing? And office hours were horrendous. I would get there, right on time, we&#39;d do like raise your hand, whatever. And there&#39;d be like two TAs there and I would wait for like, it would tell you how long the wait is. Sometimes it would be three hours, and then they would come and fix

**Michelle Chen:**         Oh is that the online, the platform thing? Yeah. Oh I&#39;ve never used that.

**JL:**         Because there&#39;s just so many students there and they&#39;re like, it was ridiculous.

**Michelle Chen:**         Did you ever ask them for help? Like the other students there?

**JL:**         Sometimes also, but I  know anyone and other people in office hours are the ones that like don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on. And like I would try to start stuff early and just say get so discouraged, it was bad bad. That class was very discouraging.

**Michelle Chen:**         So then I guess two questions is like why did you decide to keep going? Right.

**JL:**         Well I&#39;d like heard that 201 was bad and I was excited for my classes this time and I&#39;m like if I don&#39;t have to do anything like 201 again it&#39;d be like okay. And like also I don&#39;t have time to change my major again so I&#39;m kind of like stuck and then I like, I really like two of my three classes this semester so I&#39;m like okay this is better. So I know that even though they&#39;re hard. I still like enjoy it.

**Michelle Chen:**         Which ones do you like and not like?

**JL:**         So I like to 250 and I&#39;m in 270, which is intro to AI. It&#39;s so card, but so cool.

**Michelle Chen:**         And so you like it? I didn&#39;t take it because I thought it would be too hard.

**JL:**         And I like I&#39;m also doing the BA so it&#39;s also kind of like I just haven&#39;t taken like multi or any of the math and feel like--

**Michelle Chen:**         Oh,  is it math heavy?

**JL:**         A ittle bit. Then just like other classes in general, like obviously like the BAs not as impressive or really technically based, but it&#39;s less classes and I like suck at math. I&#39;m also in 216 which is like Everything Data, and I hate it so much.

**Michelle Chen:**         You don&#39;t like it?

**JL:**         Everyone says it&#39;s easy so I like didn&#39;t take it seriously, like the homeworks are fine.

**Michelle Chen:**         But there&#39;s no test or anything, right?

**JL:**         Yeah it&#39;s just one group project and it&#39;s me and like the sigep guys and Julia and we literally get nothing done and it&#39;s like we&#39;re probably going to do so badly.

**Michelle Chen:**         I don&#39;t, my project I can see if I can find mine, it was terrible. This is 216 right?

**JL:**         Yeah, did you still get an A?

**Michelle Chen:**         I got an a and it was our final project was not good.

**JL:**         We have no idea what we&#39;re doing.

**Michelle Chen:**         But that&#39;s the thing. Okay. I guess this is the secret. It&#39;s like make your presentation look nice. Like, so this is my team. Okay this guy did not show up to anything, these two did everything, she was a senior in planning her postgraduate trip the entire time and then me and rohan like tried but we had no idea what we were doing. We were like why are divorce rates so high?

**Michelle Chen:**         Like it like looks nice but we just took one data set. I can send this to you if you want.

**JL:**         That&#39;d be great.  These look good.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. We found these online-- like we did not make these. Like do you see what I mean? It looks cool? And we&#39;re like, no, we&#39;re not using naive bayes. And then this is it. We had one excel sheet and look at how many columns, like six, seven columns and then we have these graphs and they are not difficult to make. Conclusion, love is messy. Like I don&#39;t even-- do you see?

**JL:**         It looks good. It looks very good.

**Michelle Chen:**         So I think that&#39;s what it is. You need it. Like I&#39;m sorry Jane-- this is, this was all of our data. Like I&#39;m not like some people like people like oh it looks nice and we&#39;re like yeah. And like I don&#39;t even, I think they took maybe two hours and did this by themselves and then we just sort of slapped it on here. This is literally our entire spreadsheet. So I&#39;m just, I wouldn&#39;t worry if that&#39;s what you&#39;re worried about. Then I would say you&#39;re fine.

**JL:**         We just like don&#39;t know what we&#39;re doing.

**Michelle Chen:**         You&#39;ll figure it out. You&#39;ll figure it out. Um, okay. So I guess for 201 then how could it be better? Just like better, like more office hours? Because you know what you&#39;re like maybe the third person who complained about to 201 and somebody was saying that it&#39;s taught differently every year, which is why it&#39;s such a shit show every year. It&#39;s like a different professor every year. Each one of them teaches a course in an entirely different order and they have completely different ideas for office hours. So would you say just more like individualized help or like starting the homeworks in office hours or in recitation?

**JL:**         Yeah, like give you resources to get them started. Clear things like, okay, this is what you&#39;re gonna need to look out for the. And for office hours they need way more TAs. But I guess like if it&#39;s taught differently every time it&#39;s also hard like the TA&#39;s aren&#39;t familiar with it. Like I think that&#39;s so helpful when they know.

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you know Austin Wu? He was a TA. So he&#39;s been a TA for 201 for four years and that&#39;s what he said. He was like, yeah, it&#39;s taught differently every single year. He&#39;s like, it&#39;s really frustrating to be a TA because every professor wants you to do something different and you never feel like you can really... He was also like, we need to spend way more time on these concepts instead of just being like, this is a tree and like go use it. Okay. So those are good. Um, I guess, so this is sort of the last question and it&#39;s like very all encompassing, but like, do what could the CS department do better or like do you have any qualms with the department or just sort of like things that you wish were different or that you wish could change? Because that&#39;s sort of like what I&#39;m trying to get at.

**JL:**         This semester has been--it&#39;s been tough but I think it&#39;s been like fine-- like my professors have been good and the TAs have been great. But um, I haven&#39;t had too many like big issues. I&#39;m trying to think.

**Michelle Chen:**         I just like what you said about 201 is like--

**JL:**         Yeah, that&#39;s probably the main thing--

**Michelle Chen:**         Is just your experience there. And you felt like discouraged after you left?

**JL:**         So discouraged. And actually this year even like professors will put like &#39;don&#39;t get discouraged&#39;, come to office hours, we want to help you. Even just like that helps so much. Like I like read it and I&#39;m like, oh, okay. Like it&#39;s okay to be discouraged. Like they want to help. Like that was like even just putting it out made a huge difference. Um, the uh, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything like--maybe just having resources. I think undergraduate resources is good, like undergraduates to talk to.

**Michelle Chen:**         Like do you feel like Austin feels, like did you take 201 with Austin? Do you, have you talked about it with him? Like does he feel similarly? I don&#39;t think so because I think people in the class he was friends with. That&#39;s honestly the biggest thing. So I guess like ways to make friends and meet people.

**Michelle Chen:**         That&#39;s tough to do that because it&#39;s like you don&#39;t talk to people in lecture and then the people in office hours are never the ones who--they&#39;re always who need help. OK, so like maybe a more informal way to meet people. Are you nervous about next year taking 310?

**JL:**         A little bit.

**Michelle Chen:**         310, I liked 310 a lot. I did not like 330. And what I found is that like you either really like, you liked one or the other. I&#39;ve never met anyone who likes both. So, and if you like 250, you&#39;ll probably like 310 a lot. But also like I&#39;m terrible, I never formally learned how to write a proof and so it&#39;s like super proof heavy.  Yeah. But, but like everyone doesn&#39;t bad. I think the average on our first midterm was like a 40 percent. So you kind of take the test and you know, and you&#39;re like, oh well everyone&#39;s going to fail. So like it&#39;s, I don&#39;t think you should be nervous about that.

**JL:**         I&#39;m taking like it part time too which will be nice. I heard that one&#39;s like one of the hardest.

**Michelle Chen:**         So what&#39;s your senior year schedule like? Are you almost done? You&#39;re almost done with the major, right?

**JL:**         Yes. Then I&#39;m taking--I need 310, 330, and one more elective and then I&#39;m done.

**Michelle Chen:**         So then what classes are you taking next semester?

**JL:**         310, 316. Apparently the professors like really awesome for that one. And then have to take a writing class and then I just like had a free credit. So I was taking a psych class so that&#39;s fun. Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         Have you ever thought about like TAing for compsci?

**JL:**         Yeah. This is actually, this is like a little frustrating too, like I&#39;ve been wanting to be a compsci 101 TA since I took it, like I applied to every single time. The first year they just like never answered me. Like they never sent me anything and then this semester they emailed me to like fill out a thing to like what times I was available and I&#39;ve filled out like a shit ton of times, like so many, like everything that I was available for and like, like, like they were like oh yeah we&#39;ll get back to you but, I never heard thing, like email, then they never considered, I was like okay. I guess I wasn&#39;t hired but like why was I hired? So you applied for next year? Right. I also applied for the next year too. So we&#39;ll see.

**Michelle Chen:**         And you haven&#39;t. Okay. I just feel like they are very disorganized sometimes.

**JL:**         Yeah, they never answer my emails. Like I&#39;ve emailed Forbes asking about one of his classes for next semester. He never answered. I&#39;ve emailed,,

**Michelle Chen:**         So accessibility is another problem. I would agree with that.

**JL:**         But also this guy and he&#39;s like our here and he&#39;s like I&#39;ve only taken computer science 101, and like he&#39;s a compsci 101 TA and I&#39;m like, what? Like I&#39;m sorry, that makes more sense to have a compsci  major to do this.

**Michelle Chen:**         I agree.

**JL:**         That&#39;s like, how did he get it? How did you not get hired? I thought they hired everyone? And I was just like haha no... they don&#39;t.

**Michelle Chen:**         I just think that they are very disorganized.

**JL:**         Like I&#39;ve been wanting to so bad that I didn&#39;t think-- I tutor for it now and just because of like I want to like keep up up with it. Like I loved that class so much. It was so fun.

**Michelle Chen:**         See like that&#39;s how I felt too in 101 and then I took 201 and I was like wtf.

**JL:**         I feel like 201 is definitely a weed out class.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah I agree. This is true. So I guess do you have. So my advisor is Astrachan, so he&#39;s going to be the one reading this. Do you have any like any last words or anything else because? Also thank you so much. This was great.

**JL:**         Yes! No problem. I&#39;ve like wanted to talk to you about this anyway. This stuff is so interesting.

**Michelle Chen:**         It&#39;s just like, I just think that there&#39;s a lot of things that could be different and like, I don&#39;t know. If you ever just feel stupid and stuff, like know that like I&#39;m literally, I literally chose to not pursue a career in CS because. Yeah, because I&#39;m doing like finance because yeah. Because I was like, I honestly really, what I think it was, was my experience in 308 with that guy telling me that like I was wasting his time because I was kind of like maybe that&#39;s how--

**JL:**         I mean I would be scared.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, that&#39;s how I was like, I was like, I guess industry is like this. I guess I was like, I guess if I work in concert, like this is what, that would be my life. And I was like, I don&#39;t want that. And so then I got so discouraged.  Um, yeah. And I really feel like a fraud all the time in compsci because I&#39;m like, yeah, like, yeah, I did HackDuke and stuff. But like also I was a 201 TA and I had no idea what it was doing. Just because like I had 101 for a couple of semesters and I was like, oh, maybe I should try to challenge myself. Also it&#39;s just like, it was overwhelming because there were so many students that needed help, like so many came to office hours and then it would just be like, I felt like I couldn&#39;t help anyone because it was like I see all the people there and then I&#39;d be like, I need to like help you, but like I can&#39;t spend too much time with you even though you need that attention because I need to help the, like however many other people are out there.  So I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m just saying like if you feel like a fraud, like literally I feel like that all the time and I&#39;m like I&#39;m a senior now and I&#39;m like I&#39;m graduating and I&#39;m like, I don&#39;t even know how they are letting me get this degree because like,

**JL:**         Stop it!

**Michelle Chen:**         Because I&#39;m like, okay, yeah. If you asked me to write hangman, like maybe I could write that for you in Python and get it back to you in like two days, but if you ask me anything more than that, like I don&#39;t know.

**JL:**         I feel that. I don&#39;t know if I even want to be a software engineer, like I feel like that would be a lot. There are a lot of people better at it that should do it.

**Michelle Chen:**         I would say don&#39;t think don&#39;t use that mindset because like the world needs software engineers and also like you&#39;re, you&#39;re going to be good at it. Like trust me. And also if you really like 250, like maybe you should think about not just pure code like coding, like I don&#39;t know if you really liked the idea that you could go into like hardware or something like that.  Like my sister wants to do hardware like she wants to work for like Amazon or something and like do like robotics for them or something or just like understanding like processors behind computers and like working in that area. So I don&#39;t know, just like you have a lot of options. Don&#39;t get discouraged.

**JL:**         I know I also like I&#39;m doing consulting and to feel like it&#39;s like the biggest cop out on earth

**Michelle Chen:**         Dude, I&#39;m literally doing banking.

**JL:**         I was not, I was like not prepared to do like technical interviews. I feel like I am now. But I definitely wasn&#39;t last semester when I was just taking 201. It was so bad. I definitely feel more prepared now. most. I was thinking of doing consulting to get into tech consulting and then like go into to the tech industry from there.

**Michelle Chen:**         So that&#39;s kind of what I&#39;m hoping to do. Except with banking. Yeah I&#39;m like I get it.  Banking is also the biggest cop out of all time.

**JL:**         That&#39;s like, so real.

**Michelle Chen:**         So any last thoughts or anything? Thank you.

**JL:**         Mm.. I&#39;ll send you my paper.

**Michelle Chen:**         Please do. I would like that.

**JL:**         You can like see what sources I use if you want..

**Michelle Chen:**         OK. I&#39;m going to stop the recording.

<p>
 
**CT:**         We started talking about my experience in Comp Sci, like, why I&#39;m like not, like, what I&#39;m doing after graduation and why I&#39;m not doing, like, software stuff and then he was kind of like &quot;You know what?&quot; Like, &quot;If you want to&quot; like &quot;as your side project or part of this&quot; like &quot;you can just go interview people and hear about their experiences and come back to me of things that like the Comp Sci department can do better&quot;, &#39;cause I do think there are things that they could do better. Um also, this recording is like for my notes, but yeah, I&#39;m going to like type up a report and so it would be like &quot;Hey&quot;, like, &quot;these are things that people think&quot;, like, &quot;these, these are the people&#39;s experiences&quot;, like, they have ... And it&#39;s been nice interviewing people &#39;cause everyone has very different experiences than mine and a lot of people have a problem with 201, which is like not what I was expecting. But, um, yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         Okay.

**CT:**         Does that make sense?

**CT:**         Mm-hmm (affirmative)

**Michelle Chen:**         Okay, so, first question is 308, 330, and 310, which have you taken and in what order?

**CT:**         Um, I took 308 here, I took 310 abroad, so that doesn&#39;t really count, I guess, and then I took 330 here. So, in that order, 308 and 330.

**Michelle Chen:**         Okay. And then you took 308 your sophomore spring, right?

**CT:**         Yes.

**Michelle Chen:**         And then 330 your senior fall. Okay.

**CT:**         Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         &#39;Cause ... I know &#39;cause I was in both of those.

**CT:**         Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         And did you have any C.S. education prior to attending Duke?

**CT:**         Yes. I took an Intro to C.S. class in high school, which was basically just like HTML CSS and introduction to like what computer science is I guess, but that didn&#39;t have coding. It did a little bit of like PHP stuff too.

**Michelle Chen:**         Okay.

**CT:**         And then I also took ... We didn&#39;t have AP-

**Michelle Chen:**         Mm-hmm (affirmative)

**CT:**         But, we ha, uh, it was similar to AP [crosstalk 00:01:40].

**Michelle Chen:**         Mm-hmm (affirmative)

**CT:**         It was called AT. The only difference was they didn&#39;t have to stick to the AP curriculum, but they did try to-

**Michelle Chen:**         Okay.

**CT:**         So, it was basically AP Comp Sci and it was like we learned Java.

**Michelle Chen:**         Okay. And what were the demographics?

**CT:**         Um, definitely like almost entirely male. My AT Computer Science class only had three females, me, Colette, and another girl.

**Michelle Chen:**         And out of like-

**CT:**         Out of like 20, 25. Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         Um, and did your family or ... Well, not really friends, but did your family encourage you to study C.S.

**CT:**         Um, my parents definitely encouraged me to study engineering-

**Michelle Chen:**         Okay.

**CT:**         Or like something in engineering, um, but we didn&#39;t have engineering offerings in high school, which is why I think I leaned to C.S.

**Michelle Chen:**         Okay and like what did they explicitly say? Like, &quot;you need to do this&quot;? Or was it just like &quot;you should think about this&quot;? Like-

**CT:**         Um, my parents, probably my mom more was definitely like &quot;you need to get a hard skill, like, out of college or whatever you do in your life&quot; because she ... Both my friends work in finance and then, like, with the, like, recession in 2008, like, my mom got laid off and she was like &quot;you need to be, like, self-employed and, like, have, like, not be so replaceable, like, because you can actually offer something&quot;.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

**CT:**         Um, and obviously like tech was like growing and stuff, so my ... I don&#39;t know if it was ever like explicitly, like, &quot;you need to study C.S., but like very much like sending me to like engineering camps and then making me take C.S. in high school, yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         Okay, okay. Um, and then who do you surround yourself in classes, group work, research, and other aspects of C.S.?

**CT:**         Sorry?

**Michelle Chen:**         So, like, who do you ... Like, for example, like when you do group work or when you want to do homework or study for tests, like, who surrounds you?

**CT:**         Oh, I definitely rely on like my friends in the C.S. I don&#39;t expand out of people I like already knew.

**Michelle Chen:**         So, like, what are the demographics of those people?

**CT:**         Um ...

**Michelle Chen:**         Like, what are they like and how did you find them? And-

**CT:**         Okay, well, I have one female friend in C.S., yeah, which I met in C.S. 101 working in lab together. But, other than that, I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;ve met a lot of females, so I mostly have relied on males I guess. But, these were friends I made outside of the C.S. major.

**Michelle Chen:**         Okay. And so, like, when you study, are they like mostly white, like asian, like ...?

**CT:**         Um-

**Michelle Chen:**         Either?

**CT:**         I don&#39;t even ... I wouldn&#39;t even say I have that many ... So, let ... I have two in mine, like, one who&#39;s Michael, so white Hispanic I guess-

**Michelle Chen:**         Uh-huh.

**CT:**         And then the other one is Asian white, yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. Okay. Um, and so, I guess, well, why do you think you&#39;ve chosen those individuals? Is it just &#39;cause it&#39;s easy-

**CT:**         I think it&#39;s because ... I do think that because the field is largely populated by males, you are very confident in their ability to do computer science. I find it pretty intimidating slash hard to reach out to just ran ... or not random, but like acquaintances in class. I have to feel really comfortable asking questions &#39;cause I don&#39;t want ... I feel probably like I would have been treated as if I was like not smart and I didn&#39;t want to show that or didn&#39;t know enough and I didn&#39;t want to show that.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

**CT:**         So I went to friends because I felt confident and comfortable asking them questions.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. Um, and do you think your experience in the C.S. major has been different than most male students&#39; experiences?

**CT:**         Yeah. I mean I think it was like most apparent probably in 308 in the sense that a lot of the projects were, revolved around, like, existing video games, which like, I didn&#39;t even understand like video games at first. Like, I mean, I just never played them growing up and like a lot of the ... if a lot of the projects were just like extensions of existing video games, like, I definitely think they have, like, a head ... They did, they already had, like, an advantage because they were familiar with that.

**CT:**         I also think that ... I guess, in our, in my, in 342 right now, which is like discussion based, I don&#39;t think any of us necessarily know anything about the topics, like net neutrality, like, none of us are really familiar with internet infrastructure. None of us are really in, familiar with, like, block-chain technology and all that stuff, and yet, the way they talk is as if they, like, already know everything.

**CT:**         And so, I think they-

**Michelle Chen:**         Like, guys?

**CT:**         Yeah, guys, I think they&#39;ve been able to get through computer science being confident in their abilities or being confident in what they know, whereas I don&#39;t feel like confident at all in anything I&#39;ve done necessarily.

**Michelle Chen:**         So, I mean why do you think that is? Like, and do you think it&#39;s specific to C.S. or it&#39;s like exacerbated?

**CT:**         I mean, I think it&#39;s kind of specific to C.S. I don&#39;t know. I wasn&#39;t ... Like, I guess maybe because they ... Like, also, in hack-up-ons, like, a lot of them already, like, have been hacking or know how to hack and I feel like that&#39;s something maybe they grew up kind of doing, like, with their friends or just for fun and that&#39;s not something I ever picked up for fun or knew that I wanted to try or do, like-

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

**CT:**         Computer science is very much, like, I did it because it, I was highly recommend, it was highly recommended for me to do it, but not because it was something I was like dying to do all my life, and yet, I feel like probably a lot of them are like really excited to enter the field and like really excited about like being able to recreate like the video games or whatever-

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

**CT:**         That they grew up playing.

**Michelle Chen:**         So, I guess, like, one question I have is do you feel like before you ask questions, do you, like, you need to like make sure it&#39;s not a stupid question or ... You know what I mean? &#39;Cause-

**CT:**         Yeah, definitely. I would say that I didn&#39;t really attend office hours, like, as a student at Duke. Maybe, maybe for like one or two of the classes I did, but I didn&#39;t otherwise because I kind of felt like it was very intense and then like I didn&#39;t want to sound stupid in front of anyone-

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

**CT:**         So I would just refrain from going and refrain from asking questions.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. Yeah.

**CT:**         Um, and I never asked questions in class even though I think most of the lectures are confusing in a lot of C.S. classes.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah and I, like, so, like, knowing the, knowing that most guys don&#39;t know ... A lot of them don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing, why do you think it is that you&#39;re still, that you still feel not as confident as they do? Like, do you see what I&#39;m saying? Like, yeah, you&#39;re right, they probably don&#39;t know-

**CT:**         Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         Anything about net neutrality, so why is it that ... Like, you know that, but do you still ... Does that make you want to speak up more, or are you still like &quot;No, I don&#39;t want to&quot;?

**CT:**         I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s also from like the attitude like a lot of like the environment, like in the lectures, it&#39;s like people on their computers like playing games or like surfing the internet and I don&#39;t really know, I guess, like, why they&#39;re doing that. Like, they have ... It almost feels like they don&#39;t have to pay attention, not necessarily because they don&#39;t want to-

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

**CT:**         But, it almost feels like they already ... They can figure it out on their own. And so, it kind of feels embarrassing to be like the student engaged and involved in like needing to ask questions-

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

**CT:**         Because they&#39;re all ... They can do it quickly at home on their own, you know?

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

**CT:**         Like, so, I don&#39;t know. I think that contributes to it. Like, it&#39;s not really like ... I feel like it&#39;s almost frowned upon if you don&#39;t know, if you can&#39;t say you can quickly, like, look on Core on Red and figure it out on your own, right? Um, I don&#39;t ...

**CT:**         Um, and then, I don&#39;t know. I mean, why do I still feel ... Like, I feel like possibly, so, like, when I would do my internships and the teams were mostly guys, I wouldn&#39;t say that like it&#39;s not that they were not helpful and like wouldn&#39;t answer my questions, but, or made me feel like I was not, you know, worthy or like of contributing or anything, but it kind of stems from even like ...

**CT:**         So, let&#39;s say at like, at lunch, I don&#39;t contribute to the conversation because they&#39;re talking about sports or talking about guy things that like I don&#39;t really, like can&#39;t participate in. It&#39;s not the next natural step to be quiet at lunch and then suddenly be like loud and contributing or active participate, participant in the meetings, right?

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

**CT:**         So then I think that kind of just habit of like staying quiet kind of transferred into like also the computer science aspect of like my internships, which then also remains I think in my classes.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. Interesting. Um, and then as a follow up, in what ways has your gender impacted your experience as a C.S. major?

**CT:**         Um, it definitely pushed me to give back more in the major because I felt like a compelling need to reach out to younger females in C.S. and, you know, be a very active T.A. when I was a T.A., a very patient and helpful one so that like the few girls who are evidently struggling, like, it&#39;s interesting &#39;cause I, when I was a T.A., I had a peer tutoring group for, that was, happened to just coincidentally be all three guys and then I separately had a peer tutoring group that just happened to coincidentally be all three girls, and the girls were so much more timid and had mental blocks as if like they didn&#39;t know how to do it when I don&#39;t really think that was true. They just like acted super confused and I think were just scared.

**CT:**         Whereas the guys, like, also didn&#39;t know how to do like the APTs or whatever but like pretended &quot;Oh, yeah, it&#39;s like this easy. It&#39;s like you just do this, this, and that, right?&quot; Like, and like not necessarily like having the answers but like, they were much more ... I don&#39;t ... I mean, they were much more confident. So then, like, I feel more compelled to help out the females because I want to make sure that nobody is discouraged from continuing just because it seems like a field where they can&#39;t get help.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. I just like, I really agree that it&#39;s a confidence thing if they don&#39;t know how to ... I, first of all, I don&#39;t really know where it comes from in the sense that, like, I feel like it must start when we&#39;re like very young. You know what I mean?

**CT:**         Mm-hmm (affirmative).

**Michelle Chen:**         And then I, I don&#39;t know how to fix it specifically in C.S. &#39;cause, yeah, guys usually have no idea what they&#39;re talking about.

**CT:**         Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         And then they always-

**CT:**         Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         You&#39;re so right. They&#39;re always just like &quot;Oh dude, yeah, yeah. It&#39;s obviously this, like [inaudible 00:11:56]&quot;. And then it&#39;s like, like, what did you do when they were wrong? Like, or what did they do when you, like, were they ever wrong? And what did you say to them and like how did they react?

**CT:**         Oh yeah, they were definitely wrong and I&#39;d be like &quot;Actually, like, why don&#39;t you try using an example with that and, you know, and then see if it works&quot; and then they&#39;d catch their mistakes and realize like they weren&#39;t, they didn&#39;t actually know how to do it, right?

**CT:**         Um, but to them, it&#39;s not a discouragement that they like mess up the first time or whatever, right? Whereas I feel like for females, they don&#39;t want to put anything on paper or say anything out loud that&#39;s not right. So then, they just, which is kind of hard in C.S. because you, it&#39;s not really a problem if you get something wrong because as long as you&#39;re good at debugging or you like spend time like debugging like you&#39;ll eventually get it right, right?

**CT:**         And the only way you can get it right is if you know you made a mistake and you can fix it.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

**CT:**         But like, if you are hesitant to make that first mistake like most females are, it&#39;s kind of a slow process then to get to the final like solution.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. Um, let&#39;s see, this final follow up, does gender influence how you see teammates?

**CT:**         Um, yeah, I think I&#39;m definitely like much ... I was much more afraid, especially in 308, to be in groups that was all males except for me, and I was more cautious to suggest, make suggestions. Um, I also just automatically assumed I was the one who knew the least in the group if I was in an all male group.

**CT:**         Um, which is not ... Like, I, in retrospect, not necessarily true. Um, and probably, I probably could have challenged myself harder if I unlearned more, if I didn&#39;t automatically accept the smaller or easier parts of the project because I was scared I would mess up the harder ones, right?

**CT:**         So, I definitely think that like in group projects, I automatically was assigned or self-assigned like the easier and simpler parts of the project, which I think probably might, I mean, maybe held me back a little bit in terms of I didn&#39;t take initiative to, um, challenge myself-

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

**CT:**         Technically.

**Michelle Chen:**         What about like in that Google, like, or like when you&#39;re working? Does that influence how you see, like, does gender impact how you view team, or like, people you work with?

**CT:**         Um-

**Michelle Chen:**         Or are you kind of assuming like everyone&#39;s [inaudible 00:14:30] like-

**CT:**         I mean, I think there&#39;s so much work at Google to like make people aware of like the gender issue, or at least I found in my experience, which is a good thing I mean because they&#39;re not, I&#39;ve not found, I&#39;ve not been in situations where I feel like personally discriminated against or attacked or whatever because I&#39;m a female in my teams, even though they are like generally all male. But, I do find that it&#39;s hard to feel like I can be a leader in a team that&#39;s all males because I automatically, like I said, feel kind of forcibly quieter around them in meetings because I don&#39;t vibe with them in the same way that they vibe with each other.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. Yeah. Um, how do you think your race slash socioeconomic status or other identity factors besides gender have impacted your experience in C.S. or have they?

**CT:**         I wouldn&#39;t say that I&#39;ve thought necessarily anything about it. I haven&#39;t felt, I have experienced anything necessarily because I was like Filipino or anything.

**Michelle Chen:**         Um, and then, switching gears, do you feel as if there&#39;s a community in which you&#39;re welcomed in the Duke C.S. department?

**CT:**         I mean, I wouldn&#39;t say I feel unwelcomed in the Duke C.S. department, but I don&#39;t necessarily feel like I belong to it or like I don&#39;t strongly associate with it. It would probably be my least, like, the lowest affiliation I have at Duke.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

**CT:**         I don&#39;t know because I&#39;ve never, I&#39;ve never clicked with any professors, I&#39;ve never ... And I don&#39;t necessarily feel that many professors have taken the initiative to get to know their students beyond class, so I don&#39;t feel any connections to the professors necessarily, I don&#39;t feel like I have any mentors in the Duke C.S. Department whether staff or upperclassmen.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

**CT:**         Because I don&#39;t think there&#39;s that many initiatives to provide that. I also don&#39;t feel particularly connected to my peers largely because they&#39;re Asian males who either don&#39;t show up to class or show up and are like not paying attention or show up and are like kind of obnoxious and like overconfident. So, I don&#39;t necessarily feel connected to the department.

**Michelle Chen:**         And I, like, do you wish you were? Like, would that have been better or would that have been an important part of your experience? Or is it kind of like a wash?

**CT:**         Yeah, I mean, I think it&#39;s a shame that like there&#39;s all these, there&#39;s a whole population of students who are probably going to do amazing things and I don&#39;t really feel like I have a network here that I could rely on in the future or use for my career or use to propel other people&#39;s careers forward. So, it&#39;s just kind of a shame I think.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. Um, and then now to talk about more specific classes, so, like, on a high level or just how, whatever you want to talk about, how is your, what was your experience like in 308, 310, and 330?

**CT:**         308 I thought was the most useful computer science class at Duke in terms of preparing students for industry and it was also the most hands-on class. Everything else is largely theoretical or just, yeah, like learning from the textbook. Um, so I liked 308 in that sense. I liked that it wasn&#39;t test best, which you&#39;re never really tested in computer sciences and industry. So I like that it was all about how you could do projects.

**CT:**         Um, but I did feel very intimidated at first because all of the groups I were in were males because like a lot, a lot of the class is males and that made it ... Since it&#39;s not a very ... You don&#39;t really, 308 wasn&#39;t really about teaching students things, it was about, like, pushing them to teach themselves. Since I had almost like no skills, I mean no one did, but no one had like explicit skills for that class, I felt pretty thrown off by that factor and it was made worse by the fact that like the groups were not diversified, or, like, yeah, like the groups were not diverse.

**CT:**         Um, because I felt like, I felt like a lot of groups I couldn&#39;t, there were a lot of males where they wanted to do things on their own and I didn&#39;t really feel like it was a collaborative effort to like help one another out. It was more of just like ... Since it was so fast paced and intense, like, everyone just wanted to get, take care of the work on their, like, as fast as they could or like get it done that there wasn&#39;t really the opportunity for people in the group to teach other people.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. Yeah.

**CT:**         Which I think that should be the point of like projects, like people should, peers should learn from each other or peers should learn to work with each other, but it was so intense I think that like that kind of faded from it.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

**CT:**         And then, I mean, I didn&#39;t take 310 here, so I honestly, I don&#39;t-

**Michelle Chen:**         But, I mean, what was your experience like?

**CT:**         Um-

**Michelle Chen:**         This is just my curiosity, like, are you glad you did, took it abroad?

**CT:**         Well, I&#39;m glad I took it abroad because I&#39;ve heard pretty negative things about the course here. Um, but at the same time, I don&#39;t really know that I necessarily learned the same things. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s important because it&#39;s never come up in my job at least.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

**CT:**         But like, I mean, we did, like, yeah we did a little bit of like shell stuff and whatever, but I don&#39;t really know ... I&#39;m not sure that I learned the same things I should&#39;ve learned. Um, and then 330 was probably, was definitely the most difficult computer science course at Duke.

**CT:**         Um, I think it was hard because the tests were nothing ... I mean, the tests were honestly so, like, I guess that tests are I guess supposed to be more challenging than the problem sets, but for someone who did like pretty decent on the problem sets and sure, it was because largely because we could like learn from each other and collaborate, not on the actual problem sets but on like the-

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, yeah.

**CT:**         You know, like, it was, like, the problem sets were manageable, like obviously they were hard but they were manageable but then, the tests themselves are like on whole nother planet of like I don&#39;t even know what you&#39;re doing here, even though sure, they weren&#39;t derived from the problem sets.

**CT:**         And then so I don&#39;t, it was like kind of a discouraging class &#39;cause it just kept getting worse after worse after worse. And then the lectures were not particularly helpful I thought. I mean, this is kind of mean, but it&#39;s largely also because it was hard to understand him in class. He just like spoke with a slight accent and then was like pretty monotonous and not projecting, so in a large lecture hall, that&#39;s like kind of hard to follow.

**CT:**         And then, um, I don&#39;t know, they were also just like, they were like slides going through I guess what maybe textbooks would cover but not what would be super useful to like engaging in the problem sets. I don&#39;t know.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yes. That&#39;s, that&#39;s how I feel too. Um, how hard was it for you to ask for help in these classes?

**CT:**         Like, to the staff or like to peers?

**Michelle Chen:**         Just like, uh, actually maybe more like to the staff or like T.A.

**CT:**         Um, unfortunately, I did not take advantage of T.A.s. Um, I didn&#39;t feel like I could really-

**Michelle Chen:**         How did you-

**CT:**         Ronca himself for health.

**Michelle Chen:**         I&#39;m just like, no, I just think it&#39;s amazing that you-

**CT:**         Well, I relied on help from my friends. Maybe that&#39;s why I did so poor on the tests myself, but ...

**Michelle Chen:**         I did poorly and I asked for help from everyone I knew, so, I remember when I made that list of everyone I could ask. Yeah, good, anyway, um. Okay. So, you didn&#39;t really feel like-

**CT:**         No.

**Michelle Chen:**         Okay. Um, and how could your experience in these classes have been better?

**CT:**         Personally, like, I don&#39;t know why they don&#39;t offer like tutors for like ... They offer tutors for like 101 and 201 I guess, but I don&#39;t know why they don&#39;t offer tutors at the higher level because for me, I don&#39;t ... Also, the reason I didn&#39;t go to office house because honestly I wanted clarification on a lot of like the lectures, but students only want answers to the problem sets, so it&#39;s kind of hard to like ... I actually want someone to like reteach me what I didn&#39;t understand from the lectures and I don&#39;t know how to get that accomplished because it&#39;s kind of hard to just read powerpoints yourself.

**CT:**         I mean, it&#39;s not hard, but like they don&#39;t tell everything.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

**CT:**         And you can&#39;t ask questions to the powerpoint. So, I don&#39;t-

**Michelle Chen:**         Well, I did. No, I&#39;m kidding. Yeah.

**CT:**         So, I don&#39;t really know, like, I think some students benefit from personalized attention so that they can ask the questions they actually want to ask, not the questions that answer the problem sets or that every other student has.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

**CT:**         You know? So, I think they should offer some kind of ... I don&#39;t even know if he was ... Was he available for office hours himself? Like-

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

**CT:**         That&#39;s something I didn&#39;t personally look into, but-

**Michelle Chen:**         I think so. But, I think he would just go through the answers.

**CT:**         Right. And I think students, just some students need more personalized attention [crosstalk 00:23:29] wasn&#39;t available.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. Um-

**CT:**         Also, to have recitation sections for an entire lecture hall, that doesn&#39;t make sense. Recitation should be broken down-

**Michelle Chen:**         Did you ever go to those?

**CT:**         I went to his third, but it was super unhelpful because, or not super unhelpful, but it was like kind of unhelpful, or not helpful enough for me to like make the effort to continue going. So, I think-

**Michelle Chen:**         I never went.

**CT:**         But, I think recitation should be broken down into maximum students of like ten.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

**CT:**         So that it can be, you can like stop ... &#39;Cause nobody wants to stop like a hundred person lecture every like two seconds if they didn&#39;t understand, but then how are you supposed to like learn ... How are you supposed to get your questions answered if you can&#39;t stop something every two seconds if you have questions that often?

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. That&#39;s fair. Um, what about in 308? Like, is there anything ... Or in any other class, ...

**CT:**         Like, any other kind of-

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, &#39;cause like, as I write my-

**CT:**         I mean, I also think the teachers are so secretive about past tests and like past assignments, when it&#39;s like how are you supposed to learn if you can&#39;t practice? I don&#39;t understand that. So, I would&#39;ve much appreciated like a collection of tests and I know it&#39;s harder for professors but like, I&#39;m trying to learn like I&#39;m not trying to fail the exam or be lazy about it. Like, if you let ... I don&#39;t think it&#39;s always like students don&#39;t study, students fail or don&#39;t do well because they don&#39;t study, I think it&#39;s sometimes hard to find material to study.

**CT:**         Like, I&#39;m not just gonna read like paragraphs about computer science or like computer science is about doing. So, I would have appreciated a lot more tests to practice, a lot more assignments to practice and then like that would&#39;ve ...

**CT:**         And also answer keys, like, I know there&#39;s so many like things about not giving answer keys, but I don&#39;t think practicing a problem without knowing the actual answer and being able to compare-

**Michelle Chen:**         It&#39;s helpful, yeah.

**CT:**         Is helpful at all, like ...

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

**CT:**         Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         Um ...

**CT:**         Sorry.

**Michelle Chen:**         That&#39;s okay. What about like, do you have any problems with 201? Like a lot of people [crosstalk 00:25:22]-

**CT:**         I actually did, I did not, so I don&#39;t know what that&#39;s about.

**Michelle Chen:**         Like, a lot of people feel like 201 is like the really big problems and I was like &quot;Really? &#39;Cause I feel like for me, it started at 308.&quot;

**CT:**         What did they say about 201?

**Michelle Chen:**         Just that like it was super disorganized, very not well taught, very discouraging, the office hours were a mess, like, very hard to learn, made them feel really shitty.

**CT:**         I mean personally, I didn&#39;t struggle in 201, so-

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, I didn&#39;t really-

**CT:**         I never went to office hours or ... I just thought it was the exact, almost exactly like 101 except like-

**Michelle Chen:**         In Java.

**CT:**         In Java and like maybe a little more challenging with the-

**Michelle Chen:**         Although, I will say like towards the end, I had, didn&#39;t really know what was going on.

**CT:**         Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         Like, when we were learning about like, uh, what was the last assignment? Huffman?

**CT:**         I don&#39;t even know.

**Michelle Chen:**         The one where we had to build, use a tree. Yeah. I had no idea what I was doing. Um, let&#39;s see. Okay, so, last question and this is just pretty general, but what could the C.S. Department do better?

**CT:**         Um, offer mentorship for like ... I don&#39;t, who ... People who guided me in career were like people I was lucky to meet outside of Duke, like, I don&#39;t know why I had to go through that by myself.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

**CT:**         Um, they need to hire more females. Like, I don&#39;t know why almost no professors are female. That doesn&#39;t make sense. Um, they need to hire professors who also have had industry experience if the large ... I don&#39;t know if this is the numbers, but if a large majority of C.S. students go onto industry, why the heck are like most of the professors academic, you know? Or have no experience in industry because then they&#39;re not, they don&#39;t address maybe the matters you need to know for, to do well in industry or be successful in industry.

**CT:**         Um, perhaps also that means helping students find interview prep. Like, I mean, I don&#39;t know why there&#39;s no like-

**Michelle Chen:**         Resources.

**CT:**         Resources for that. Um, and then just being more aware of like diversity, like, the need for diversity, um, like ... I understand that like a class if, a class can be majority male, but like when you&#39;re making random groups, why ... Of course that means that like there&#39;s going to be one female per group or whatever. I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s not impossible to just like put, make a female group so that like ... I don&#39;t know, to see how that does or if that helps females learn better.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

**CT:**         Um, just like more, yeah, more availability of help resources, whether it&#39;s more tutors, whether it&#39;s more office hours, like, whether it&#39;s training T.A.s better, whether it&#39;s, um, uh, having more practice problems and tests available.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

**CT:**         That&#39;s definitely like the biggest one I think.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. Interesting.

**CT:**         And I, I don&#39;t know. Personally, I like have kind of, I, like, very casually mentioned this to four of us in class the other day, but I don&#39;t understand why tests are designed so that averages are below 50. Like, I just don&#39;t understand that. It&#39;s, they should, I feel like, do some research into like the psychology behind that, like &#39;cause I feel like there&#39;s something about ... That personally discourages me a lot and I don&#39;t necessarily think that I can continue to do worse because I study less or like don&#39;t study right or whatever. I think largely a mental block forms when I continuously receive below 50s, like ...

**Michelle Chen:**         I don&#39;t know. For me, it was always like &quot;Oh, that means I don&#39;t know how to do everything right, get everything right on the test.&quot;

**CT:**         I guess.

**Michelle Chen:**         But also, yeah, I, I understand that. I ... It&#39;s cause C.S. is supposed to be hard and challenging and whatever.

**CT:**         Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         Okay. Um, yeah, it&#39;s 2:27 and I have to go soon. Do you have any, any last words that you want me to pass onto [inaudible 00:29:02]?

**CT:**         Um, I feel like also just like a diversity, more diversity in the electives offered or more electives offered. I just feel like I was never interest, particularly interested in any of them.

**Michelle Chen:**         Any of them. Yeah.

**CT:**         There&#39;s not a lot of electives that are super relevant to what&#39;s going on in tech right now.

**Michelle Chen:**         So like, what kind electives would you want?

**CT:**         Like basic deep learning, I don&#39;t know, so that people can move onto like the really cool things that tech is doing with A.I. right now, right? Or like ... I mean, even some people like don&#39;t even know web development and yeah, sure, that&#39;s something you can teach yourself, but like I don&#39;t ... Not all students have the time to, and yet, that&#39;s super relevant for like just if you want to freelance or whatever, you know?

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

**CT:**         So, just like actually like useful skills, I don&#39;t know.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. That&#39;s fair. Okay. Well ...

<details><summary>Interviewee - SD </summary>
<p>
  
**SD:**         Okay, so yeah, anyway, now that I&#39;ve explained sort of the premise of my...

**Michelle Chen:**         So is this a personal project?

**SD:**         Yeah. So, I mean, it&#39;s not really for anything necessarily; it&#39;s not like this is gonna be, like, published anywhere, but I kind of want to give my parting gift to the department. It will be sort of me saying, &quot;Hey, here are some experiences people have had that like haven&#39;t been super awesome,&quot; and, like, or maybe you have had awesome experiences—that&#39;s why I want to talk to a lot of people. And then like sort of give them a report and say the sort of the good, the bad and the ugly. If not for that, like, if it goes nowhere, if they never read it or use it, that&#39;s, like, at least I...

**Michelle Chen:**         Um, okay. So my first question is, what year are you at Duke?

**SD:**         I&#39;m 2019, so I&#39;m a junior right now.

**Michelle Chen:**         Okay. And then, um, have you taken 308, 330, or 310?

**SD:**         So I&#39;m currently in 330—I didn&#39;t take 308 but I did the 290 mobile version of it the first semester it was offered and then 310 next semester.

**Michelle Chen:**         You&#39;re taking it next semester?

**SD:**         Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         Okay. And then, so you took 290 then 330, then you&#39;re going to take 310. That was the order.

**SD:**         Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         Um, so did you have any computer science education prior to attending Duke?

**SD:**         Yeah, so I actually, um, like, learned Python on my own, like, the summer before coming, and then I took a CompSci class in my high school but I don&#39;t think I learned anything...

**Michelle Chen:**         And, like, what were the demographics of that class?

**SD:**         Oh yeah, so, like, um... okay, so I actually, like, we have a CompSci class—so I went to a math and science high school—so we had, like, the intro AP CompSci class and then it went all the way to, like, the next level, like, data structures. So I went the full, like, I took the full year of it. And, in my intro class, I&#39;d say, like... 25% girls. But then, in my data structures class, I was, like, one of two girls.

**Michelle Chen:**         Out of..?

**SD:**         Out of, I&#39;d say, like, 12 people? Or maybe, like, 15 people interested.

**Michelle Chen:**         Oh, interesting.

**SD:**         Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         And then was it also, like, 16 people in the intro class?

**SD:**         The intro was a little bigger, like 20 maybe.

**Michelle Chen:**         Okay. Do your friends and family encourage you to study CompSci?

**SD:**         Yeah. So my parents are pretty, like, um, they don&#39;t really—they&#39;re pretty...

**Michelle Chen:**         Chill?

**SD:**         Chill about whatever I wanna do. I mean—granted, I am, like, I chose CompSci, so yeah. My friends? Yeah. I mean, I feel like people are always like, &quot;Yeah! Girls who code!&quot;

**Michelle Chen:**         So do they—is there anyone who, like, doesn&#39;t support it? Like did your parents want you to be CompSci?

**SD:**         Um, they were pretty indifferent. I would say my dad—like, definitely there was some resistance at first.

**Michelle Chen:**         Really?

**SD:**         Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you know why?

**SD:**         Um, yeah. So he, like, he said—he was a software engineer for a really long time and he was just like, this is mundane.

**Michelle Chen:**         Okay.

**SD:**         And, like, he&#39;s basically like, &quot;You could do something more interesting.&quot;

**Michelle Chen:**         I feel that.

**SD:**         That&#39;s understandable, because, like, yeah, it is mundane.

**Michelle Chen:**         That&#39;s fair.

**SD:**         Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         Um, so I guess, like, in your classes and group work and research—I don&#39;t know if you do research but other aspects of CompSci—who you surround yourself with?

**SD:**         Oh yeah, like, definitely, um... I mean, like, so I have a lot of guy friends in CompSci. Like, most of my dude friends are CompSci majors, but I would never work with them on a project or, like, on homework.

**Michelle Chen:**         Why?

**SD:**         It&#39;s just like... especially if they&#39;re, like, Asian guys, because they&#39;re just like... I don&#39;t know—they&#39;re not fun to work with. Yeah, I&#39;d say the only exception I would work with is Steven, right? But Steven and I have worked together for so long, so I feel comfortable and I know our work habits are similar, but, like, I would... Yeah. If I went to a hackathon, I would ask girls to go with me. As for my homework—my CompSci homework—I either do it alone or...

**Michelle Chen:**         But you wouldn&#39;t want to work with them because... is it because they&#39;re know-it-all&#39;s? Honestly, that&#39;s why I hate working with guys. Like, I feel like they—also, I feel like they&#39;ll judge me.

**SD:**         No, yeah, I feel like they&#39;ll judge me and I feel like they just... don&#39;t explain things the way that I want to be explained to, you know, and...

**Michelle Chen:**         You feel like they&#39;re, like, patronizing you?

**SD:**         Yeah, I don&#39;t feel like I have high expectations for, like, explanations. I just feel like they... I feel like sometimes guys explain things to you with the expectation that they&#39;re, like, you&#39;re not going to understand.

**Michelle Chen:**         And that they&#39;re smarter than you.

**SD:**         Yeah, and I&#39;m just like... um. Like, first of all this isn&#39;t, like, I don&#39;t even like this, so like...

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, I get that. So you feel like you... do you try to surround yourself then with women? Like, do you try to work with girls on homework?

**SD:**         Women will also... I found, like, I&#39;m also uncomfortable around a lot of women too. I&#39;m pretty particular about who I work with. And, like, I feel like part of it is just because... it&#39;s kinda competitive.

**Michelle Chen:**         The women are?

**SD:**         Yeah. And I also think that because I&#39;m not doing software, like I&#39;m doing UX, right? I mean, so I feel like, for one, I feel less confident about my coding, right? Because, like, I don&#39;t—I&#39;m not really pursuing, like, a coding career.

**Michelle Chen:**         Dude, tell me about it.

**SD:**         Yeah, and then like I feel like other people are like, &quot;Oh, she&#39;s UX.&quot;

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you feel like people look down on you?

**SD:**         Yeah, yeah, a little bit. Um, girls included.

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you think people would look down on you for doing UX if you were a guy?

**SD:**         I don&#39;t know. So the thing about, like, not many guys are UX. I think I&#39;ve met like two. My initial reaction is always like, &quot;That&#39;s cool.&quot; But I don&#39;t know what a guy would think about that.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. So you feel like your peers actively think less of the fact that you&#39;re doing UX?

**SD:**         Yeah. Or... yeah, I feel like that&#39;s a, that&#39;s a thing.

**Michelle Chen:**         Have they said anything? This is just—I&#39;m just curious.

**SD:**         I know, like, Andy has been like, &quot;Oh that&#39;s, like, less mentally stimulating.&quot; Like, he&#39;s explicitly said that.

**Michelle Chen:**         He said that?

**SD:**         Yeah, about UX and front-end. So it&#39;s, like, uncomfortable because I&#39;m like...

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, and it makes you feel shitty because—I mean, I don&#39;t know about you, but I already going into recruiting, didn&#39;t feel good about my skills, so then when you—when you get people saying that, I&#39;m sure it doesn&#39;t feel that great. Then why do you think you&#39;ve chosen, like, these individuals to surround yourself with?

**SD:**         I don&#39;t know. Like, as friends?

**Michelle Chen:**         I would say first—okay, I guess two parts. First as friends, but then when you said, like, &quot;They&#39;re my friends, but I never worked with them.&quot; So the people that you would work with why did you choose those two?

**SD:**         Okay, well, first part: I guess, I mean, well, these friends are not... I guess, I don&#39;t know, people who are cool to hang out with. Like, school is pretty, um, scary for me. So I can&#39;t... Like, I can&#39;t be as scared of everything in life as I am as of school and career stuff I guess. Like, if I—just because I don&#39;t feel comfortable sharing my school and academic stuff with them, like, doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not comfortable sharing other things. Yeah, but definitely those are things that I think about when I&#39;m like, &quot;What kind of person are you?&quot; Um, second, who do I choose to, like, why do I surround people—what kind of people do I surround myself when I&#39;m working with them and why? I guess, I feel... Okay, this is kind of shitty, but I feel like I can&#39;t work with people who are known to be really good, right? I feel better when I pick someone who—people are always like, &quot;Oh you just gotta get a good partner and you&#39;re fine,&quot; but I don&#39;t feel that way. I feel like I want, like, a mediocre partner so we can learn together.

**Michelle Chen:**         Because you don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re lagging behind?

**SD:**         Yeah, right.

**Michelle Chen:**         But then why do you feel like—when you said, like, &quot;When I go to a hackathon, I would want girls to come&quot; with you. Like, why is that?

**SD:**         I feel like—okay, I mean, the first hackathon I ever went to was with three girls. It was an all-girl hackathon and it was just... It was a really good experience. Like, I just remember we were all learning together. The next hackathon I went to—I was the only girl on the team, actually—it was with Andy, Cody, David, who are all, like, really good, but I just sat there and, like, didn&#39;t really do anything and no one really made an effort to include me. Yeah. So two very different experiences. And, like, in 330, I feel like—so I actually study with two guys now. And I feel like, on the first midterm—so one of the guys definitely knows more of the lab work, so the other guy who knows less is always asking the guy who knows more and I&#39;m like, well, why? Like, addresses this guy. And I&#39;m like, well what about me, you know, why am I not ever being addressed? And then, like, second midterm comes around and I&#39;m like, &quot;I&#39;m going to stunt on you&quot; and &quot;Dude, you don&#39;t understand this; I&#39;m going to explain it.&quot; And, like, I had to go through that and I had to prove myself to them before they started asking me questions.

**Michelle Chen:**         I totally get that.

**SD:**         Okay, yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         Because they automatically assume that you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing.

**SD:**         But it felt good afterwards, not gonna lie.

**Michelle Chen:**         But I guess—so one thing that made me think of is—I feel like if I were on a hackathon team and it were all girls and they were all super smart, like if they were all like Andy, Cody... you said David, right?

**SD:**         David, yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         If those three girls were Andy/Cody/David-level, I feel like my experience would be good. I feel like they would teach me. Or I would at least feel like there was someone on my side that was at least trying to include me.

**SD:**         Yeah, it&#39;s different. I think, with that, it&#39;s like—I think if I worked with girls who were like them, it would be less about them teaching me and more about me being self-conscious that I&#39;m like, &quot;Oh, am I going to bring them down?

**Michelle Chen:**         Did you feel that way, though? With Andy, Cody, and them?

**SD:**         Yeah. Yeah, I definitely did, and that&#39;s why I was scared to try anything, because I kind of went in with the mentality that, hey, if I&#39;m not gonna—I&#39;d rather contribute zero than negative, you know? So then I didn&#39;t get much out of it, but at the same time it was a really big step outside my comfort zone for me. I was proud of myself for going.

**SD:**         That makes sense.

**SD:**         Yeah, because, like, you know, um, yeah. So, like, I feel like that had negative and positive effects.

**SD:**         I guess I totally understand what you say about wanting a mediocre partner because you don&#39;t want to be, like, feeling like you&#39;re dead weight. Do you feel like that a lot?

**SD:**         I feel like that a lot, partially because I have really bad work ethic, so that&#39;s me in maybe every class. But also because, like, CS, you know? Like, coding projects just, like... I&#39;ve never been so anxious for homework as I am for coding assignments.

**Michelle Chen:**         Me too. Yeah. Interesting. Do you think your experience in the CompSci major has been different than most male students&#39; experiences? And, if so, how?

**SD:**         I don&#39;t really know, just because... I guess I wouldn&#39;t know what their experience is like. But my experiences are just that... there&#39;s not much the CompSci department is actively doing—that you can see, at least—to help women out. Right? Because I feel like a really obvious thing is increasing the number of female TAs you see in classes past 101. But, like, 201? Even just going from 101 to 201 there&#39;s a huge drop, which is, like—at least have a girl in the classroom teaching recitation or something. I don&#39;t know. But other than that, I feel like I have a lot of qualms about the CompSci department that aren&#39;t as gender-related.

**Michelle Chen:**         We&#39;ll get to them in a second. Do you feel like your guy friends are as not confident as you are?

**SD:**         No, for sure not. I feel like they thrive more. Definitely seeing guys—they have different... goals.

New Speaker:        What do you mean?I just want to, like—I don&#39;t know—I feel like my goal is pretty bare minimum and if I achieve that, then I&#39;m happy. But theirs is like... they need to go beyond, like way further than whatever I want. Like, my goal is to get one job and call it a day and be proud of myself. Or, like, do one personal... I don&#39;t know, like, do a personal project and be happy about it. But theirs are always like... they&#39;re a lot more hungry for things, and I feel like that&#39;s because they have more confidence to pursue it.

**Michelle Chen:**         Definitely.  So I guess just a couple more questions about gender. In what ways has your gender impacted your experience as a CompSci major? Or has it?

**SD:**         I&#39;m just trying to think about, like, what classes I&#39;ve even taken.

**Michelle Chen:**         It could be in classes, in research, in extra curriculars, if there&#39;s any other CompSci environment.

**SD:**         I just feel like my gender—I feel like any sort of gender effects is expected, you know? It&#39;s kinda sad, but you&#39;re not surprised when it happens. It&#39;s pretty every day, like implicit bias kind of stuff, I feel like.

**Michelle Chen:**         Like what?

**SD:**         It mostly shows when working in groups, like being given less tasks, not being asked questions, not being asked for feedback—which hasn&#39;t happened to me too often yet because I&#39;ve been picking groups that I&#39;m comfortable with, but looking at hackathons and... I don&#39;t know. But HackDuke has been pretty... it&#39;s been fine. I know there&#39;s a pretty high... well, I don&#39;t know. There&#39;s no girls in the tech team, you know? And I feel like I&#39;m scared to be—I feel like when I first joined HackDuke, tech team was really cool to be on... because I didn&#39;t know I hated coding. But it was just scary because there was one girl and it was Amy, who was really quiet. Yeah, I think it&#39;s just everyday small things like that. But yeah, I don&#39;t really think about—I don&#39;t really think about my experience as a CompSci major much because I feel pretty, like, my CompSci major has just been, like, a means to an end for me. So, like, if I hate it, if it&#39;s shitty—which I do, like, I don&#39;t enjoy my CompSci studies. I kinda just suck it up because it&#39;s like, I know I&#39;m going to be doing something else when I graduate. So I feel like I haven&#39;t given this the thought that I maybe should be.

**Michelle Chen:**         We sort of talked about this, but does gender influence how you see your teammates, or see potential teammates for you?

**SD:**         Oh, yeah, for sure. Like, I don&#39;t think I would ever, like, one of my best friends is going to be in 310 with me next semester and I&#39;ve known him since middle school and he&#39;s like, &quot;Oh, I want to work with blank other Asian boy; do you want to be in our group?&quot; And I&#39;m just like, if you had said maybe if I want to work with... Girl I Don&#39;t Know, even, I would&#39;ve been more inclined, but the thought of just, like... I don&#39;t know. These are two people who I know really well and I&#39;m really good friends with, and so it&#39;s like, why don&#39;t I want to work with them?

**Michelle Chen:**         Are you worried about what you think they&#39;ll think of you, or are you just like, &quot;I&#39;ll be dead weight&quot;?

**SD:**         I think it&#39;s partially just because I have this image in my mind that guys are not gonna, like—guys are not as supportive, usually. And that stems from my experiences from before, so these are two people I&#39;ve never worked with, so they could very well be great partners.  don&#39;t know anything about their ability to do CompSci, but... So I feel like it&#39;s pretty clear that I was just like, oh, two boys, fuck.

**Michelle Chen:**         That makes sense.

**SD:**         Like, why? I think it&#39;s just because—I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m going to be dead weight, but if I do end up feeling like that, they&#39;re not gonna do anything to help it. I&#39;m just, like, I don&#39;t... I just feel like I wouldn&#39;t grow as much, which I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true or not, but I still go in with that feeling.

**Michelle Chen:**         That makes sense. How do you think your race or socioeconomic status or other identity factors besides gender has impacted your CS experiences?

**SD:**         I&#39;m sure they&#39;ve helped it. I feel like being an Asian girl is much better than being... I&#39;m still a woman of color, but I feel like this is one of the things where East Asians get privilege. So, nothing too negative, maybe, but sometimes I feel like I&#39;m not doing enough to support other women of color who are more marginalized? I also feel like, what can I do? Because then I&#39;d be—if I tried to create something for them, or like... I&#39;d have to do it with them, right? Because if I tried to step in, that&#39;d be, like, taking up space. And, like, it&#39;s a hard thing to balance because, yeah, you want to start—like say you want to start a women in tech thing, but do you exclude white women? Do you exclude East Asians? You know what I mean, right? These are people who are, like... yeah, they&#39;re discriminated against but also having them in a space makes other people—like Black women, probably—they&#39;ll feel more... I feel like there should be a space just for them, or Latinas.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. Okay, also, this isn&#39;t in my interview question list, but speaking as... Your friends know you directed HackDuke, right?

**SD:**         Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you think that that has impacted how they see you—has it helped you in any way? Because, for me, for example, it was so weird—I always felt like people knew that I was the director, but they didn&#39;t necessarily think more highly of me as a coder or a student; they just thought I had influence on campus, if that makes sense.

**SD:**         Yeah, I feel like, for sure, I think people&#39;s impression of me do change after they find out, like, oh, I did this. But I feel like it doesn&#39;t really... yeah, I don&#39;t think anyone has ever been like—okay, my non-coding friends will be like, &quot;Oh, you directed HackDuke; you have to be good at this,&quot; but that&#39;s different, right?

**Michelle Chen:**         That&#39;s different. They don&#39;t know.

**SD:**         But my coding friends are just like, &quot;Oh, you directed HackDuke. Cool.&quot;

**Michelle Chen:**         &quot;Can I get free stuff?&quot;

**SD:**         Yeah. And they don&#39;t realize how much thought went into it, but it&#39;s fine.

**Michelle Chen:**         That&#39;s how I feel too. Do you feel as if there&#39;s a community in which you&#39;re welcome in the Duke CS Department?

**SD:**         So I don&#39;t think—I don&#39;t feel like I have a community, which is weird because I have so many CS friends. But then you ask me, like—but then I go and take a class and I&#39;m like, &quot;Fuck, well, who am I gonna partner with?&quot; Because I feel like—I would expect that I would be like, &quot;Oh, I could partner with blank or blank,&quot; but through elimination of who I&#39;d wanna work with and whatever, there&#39;s only, like, one or two or three people left, and it&#39;s like, wow... for the number of—because I have a pretty homogenous group of friends, and a lot of them are in tech. I still don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s a tech community. I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t feel like there&#39;s people I can talk to about tech comfortably.

**Michelle Chen:**         Interesting.

**SD:**         Yeah. Or there&#39;s a group. There are individuals I can talk to comfortably.

**Michelle Chen:**         So, I mean, do you think that&#39;s a you thing? Do you think a lot of people feel like that?

**SD:**         I think a lot of people feel like that. Um, I&#39;ve met a lot of girls, but also girls who don&#39;t have friends in tech. I have a friend who&#39;s like a polisci-CompSci double major and she got into CompSci kind of late and she&#39;s not really in any CompSci club, so she literally has nobody to talk to about, like—when you&#39;re recruiting, you learn a lot of stuff from your friends and stuff, right? But she just, like, missed out on a lot of it because she has physically zero CompSci friends and I feel like that&#39;s something on Duke&#39;s end, too. I don&#39;t think Duke does anything to support community within CompSci. Yeah, we have Catalyst and HackDuke and Wiring with Women, but these are all things you have to apply for, which is another—

**Michelle Chen:**         You have to apply for Wiring with Women?

**SD:**         No, well, from what I&#39;ve heard, Wiring with Women doesn&#39;t really have a good community, but that&#39;s that&#39;s not on them. It&#39;s kinda hard to, like, pave a way.

**Michelle Chen:**         I mean, so then, what are your ideas? Like, how do we make a community?

**SD:**         Yeah, no, I think this is just like, I just think there should be something... okay, actually I tried to do this last semester, but then it didn&#39;t work out—well, l didn&#39;t really see it through also. I think like there needs to be some sort of, like, CompSci department-sponsored thing, because even if it doesn&#39;t, um, like even if it&#39;s not that close-knit or whatever, it&#39;s at least, like—one—it&#39;s, like, hey, maybe we care? It&#39;s, like, I don&#39;t know, maybe it&#39;s just going through the motions but maybe it will actually make people feel more reaffirmed. Especially as freshmen, knowing there&#39;s, like, hey, I have this resource. And also, being connected with anyone who knows, like, if you&#39;re a freshman—so I feel like being a sophomore and freshmen in CompSci is so entirely different. So, like, just knowing one person is really helpful and I think the CompSci department should come up with something for that, because then there are no barriers to entry, like anyone could do it. You don&#39;t have to—it&#39;s not like... it&#39;s not really like cliquey like Catalyst and HackDuke. Um, yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         Um, let&#39;s see. Now I want to ask sort of about your specific classes. Um, so I guess just talk really quickly about your experience in—you&#39;re in 330, right?

**SD:**         Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         So tell me about—what you think of when you think of 330. Like, was it hard for you to ask for help? Like, how could your experience has been better in 330?

**SD:**         Okay, well, first of all, the grad TAs are kind of, like, assholes.

**Michelle Chen:**         Really? Why?

**SD:**         One of them is just, like, really just—okay, they&#39;re all really smart.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

**SD:**         One of them—he&#39;s straight out of undergrad and he is really smart. I don&#39;t know. He&#39;s really smart but he&#39;s really bad at explaining and I always feel like he&#39;s judging me. I&#39;ve never even asked him a question, but I went to his discussion once and just hearing him and from what I&#39;ve heard other people say about him, I just, I don&#39;t want to...

**Michelle Chen:**         What do they say? Like that he&#39;s..?

**SD:**         Um, he&#39;s just, like, he explains things like—he assumes you know things, which is, like, kind of annoying because it&#39;s like, well, what if I don&#39;t? How do I—how do I ask you now? Um, yeah. And then, like, he&#39;s also just really mean, like a mean grader.

**Michelle Chen:**         Really?

**SD:**         Oh, yeah, it&#39;ll literally be, like—this is literally like every question, every homework, the answer—I&#39;ll get, like, really good on the other ones or, like, pretty good, and then the question he grades, it&#39;s, like, minus 10, &quot;lack of clarity and runtime description and runtime analysis&quot; and I&#39;m like...

**Michelle Chen:**         You&#39;re like, &quot;Okay...&quot;

**SD:**         Yeah, and this happens to everybody, and I&#39;m just like...

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

**SD:**         Yeah... which is fine because it&#39;s curved, but it&#39;s still like...

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. So my last question is, what could the CS department do better? Like, what do you wish—or what do you wish there was/what changes, ideally, could be made?

**SD:**         Well, I mean, I think the biggest thing for me is I&#39;d love to see more support for, like... okay, well, first of all, there&#39;s not really support for people who are going to software—there&#39;s 308, that&#39;s about all. I&#39;d love to see more support for people who aren&#39;t doing software because that would feel, like, that would probably make me feel more prideful or more excited or—I&#39;m excited about my choice and I feel like it&#39;s right for me. But sometimes, I do feel like I&#39;m being judged when I&#39;m saying &quot;Hey, I&#39;m doing UX not CompSci.&quot; So, like, that&#39;d be cool if something is done about that. Um, but also just like... I don&#39;t know. Like, the obvious ones, like classes—I have zero choice of classes next semester. I&#39;ve literally taken all the classes and, like, I haven&#39;t even taken that many which is like, okay... I don&#39;t know, just like... I feel like the CompSci department doesn&#39;t really listen. They&#39;re really unorganized, which is an issue because there&#39;s...

**Michelle Chen:**         So many people?

**SD:**         Yeah, like, CompSci is growing so quickly, and I guess if it&#39;s not... like, that&#39;s a lot of men we&#39;re feeding into the workplace who are problematic and a lot of women who are also going into the workplace with not a lot of confidence. So it&#39;s like... like what any change they make affects a lot of people and it&#39;s growing every freaking year. I don&#39;t know. I also wish they gave me more support for, um, outside endeavors. I don&#39;t know. I feel like it&#39;s just all about class.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, that&#39;s fair. Any other qualms?

**SD:**         I feel like a lot of qualms are obvious.

**Michelle Chen:**         Like what?

**SD:**         Just, like, classes, professors. I know those aren&#39;t quick fixes, but the CompSci department has like... okay, one thing they did that I thought was cool was that CompSci department holiday party. It was kind of silly but, like, I don&#39;t know. It was nice that they did something for the students. I don&#39;t know. Also just, like, not—I think a big thing is a lot of people get caught cheating in 201 or, like, the earlier ones. It affects girls a lot more than it affects guys.

**Michelle Chen:**         What do you mean? Like they get caught more?

**SD:**         No, like girls—I feel like guys are just like, &quot;It&#39;s fine.&quot; Like, they brush it off, and then girls are like, &quot;Well crap. That happened.&quot; Yeah. And then it stays with them for a while and like... yeah. I don&#39;t know, something should be done about the whole academic dishonesty thing. Because not just for like, hey, this doesn&#39;t work educationally, but also there are long-term effects on people trying, who are maybe interested in CompSci.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. Interesting.

**SD:**         And I feel like they&#39;re not doing anything to increase the retention rates, because everybody knows that a bunch of girls drop out from, like, 201 to 250.

**Michelle Chen:**         But, like, we can&#39;t—I don&#39;t know what they could. Do you have ideas?

**SD:**         So one thing that was really cool was, like, Anna Miyajima—when she became a 308 TA, she was like, &quot;I will do it only if I get to TA girls.&quot; So, like, I don&#39;t know. They could take some inspiration from that or...

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. I see what you&#39;re saying.

**SD:**         I feel like... guys are not—people who make the place uncomfortable are not held accountable and I don&#39;t know how they would be held accountable, right? But like, yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         That&#39;s true. Doing these interviews just makes me, like, sad, because I&#39;m leaving. And my absolute last question: do you think that—do you know anyone that you think would be good for me to talk to?

**SD:**         Wait, can I mention one other thing? So when I brought up me and Archina(?) and Allawah(?)

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, I know her.

**SD:**         And Ozi.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, I know Ozi.

**SD:**         So Ozi was kinda, like, sketch about this. But we brought up to Forbes and Astrachan that we wanted to start with mentorship program, like, within the CompSci department, whatever. And, like, it kind of fell through because all of us had clauses and, like, the three—Ozi was kinda doing it for his resume or something, which also was not cool. I don&#39;t know. It just fell through, which is my fault a little bit. But also, why didn&#39;t they pursue it? Because they had the resources, they have the money, they literally said that to us. Why didn&#39;t they reach back out to us when we didn&#39;t say anything, you know? This is something they could&#39;ve implemented, or at least try to get people on board for it. So yeah, that&#39;s kinda... I don&#39;t know. That was kinda sad.

**Michelle Chen:**         That they didn&#39;t...

**SD:**         Yeah. Anyone you want to talk to or I wanna talk to or I think you should talk to?

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah, people who would be good to interview.

**SD:**         I think you should interview girls and boys.

**Michelle Chen:**         I am talking to Ozi, Phillip Moss—I don&#39;t know if you know him.

**SD:**         I do. Wait, isn&#39;t he really, really smart?

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

**SD:**         He&#39;s your grade, right?

**Michelle Chen:**         He&#39;s awesome. He started this Black CS office hours and they&#39;re, like, only black people can go.

**SD:**         See? Like, that&#39;s cool.

**Michelle Chen:**         That&#39;s cool. Yeah. Exactly. I&#39;m just thinking because I really want as wide of a dataset as possible because, right now, I&#39;m only talking to people that I know and it&#39;s like... I feel like it could be helpful.

**SD:**         See, this is what I&#39;m saying. Like, I can&#39;t think of CS people, which is really sad.

**Michelle Chen:**         Like, any of your girlfriends. Anyone you know who just feels not confident in CS.

**SD:**         See, I think of Archina(?). She has really good insight on these things.

**Michelle Chen:**         I&#39;m going to talk to her.

**SD:**         Yeah, definitely talk to Archina(?). I&#39;ll try to message you if I think of someone because I feel like I have to look through a list.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yes, please, please do.

**SD:**         I also think it&#39;d be really interesting if.. so Katherine Guo—she&#39;s dating David—she&#39;s really good at CompSci, like, she&#39;s really good, like, she has a 3.96 or something.

**Michelle Chen:**         Wow.

**SD:**         And she&#39;s just really fucking smart. But, like, I think it&#39;d be interesting to hear her perspective, right?

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you think she feels confident?

**SD:**         See, that&#39;s what I don&#39;t know because she&#39;s mentioned it before with recruiting.

**Michelle Chen:**         Really.

**SD:**         But she literally got Facebook, Google, Amazon, like... what was the other one? Microsoft. And like—

**Michelle Chen:**         Apple?

**SD:**         No—the KPCB.

**Michelle Chen:**         Oh, damn. She did?

**SD:**         Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         Damn.

**SD:**         But, like, I don&#39;t know. She&#39;s really... technically privileged, I guess. Her parents are—like, she&#39;s from the Bay, her parents are both software engineers, her brother worked at Palantir—

**Michelle Chen:**         Where&#39;s David going?

**SD:**         David&#39;s going to Airbnb. So Kathy&#39;s, like, you know, she&#39;s kinda like a tech child. But it&#39;d be interesting to—I don&#39;t know if she&#39;d provide, I don&#39;t know what&#39;d she say, but it might be interesting to hear from her perspective. She&#39;s also a 330 TA right now.

**Michelle Chen:**         So that means she must have killed that class.

**SD:**         Oh yeah, she did.

**Michelle Chen:**         Also, you can go if you need to. I might sit here.

**SD:**         I&#39;m gonna go. I have HackDuke at 7.

**Michelle Chen:**         Thank you. Truly.

<details><summary>Interviewee - PM </summary>
<p>

**PM:**         Ok, so I just want to start off by saying like, you&#39;re amazing for doing this because like I think this is so much of the work that&#39;s necessary because the computer science--the computer science department is terrible at Duke and um, yeah, I, I can&#39;t even speak from a place of like, cause I&#39;m a cis man, right? Um, knowing that sexual assault, gender violence is like an an issue on campus and of course as the one of the most popular majors it&#39;s created problems so I can&#39;t even speak to that. But um, I really appreciate that you&#39;re doing this. I just want that to be recorded.

**Michelle Chen:**         Thank you!

**PM:**         Um, but uh, yeah, so, so yeah. So I have a lot to say. Just interject with questions, want me to just talk?

**Michelle Chen:**         So I have questions but also like if you want to talk at the beginning-- so some people have been like, I want to say something first and we go off of that, and some people are like just like hit me with your questions.

**PM:**         I think I want to just like respond with, with what&#39;s on my mind given what you just said in your intro. So I think that definitely, like I&#39;m definitely more insecure regarding compsci now than when I began. Like definitely. I feel like that I feel like definitely like don&#39;t know, like it&#39;s just like, I mean what you said like feeling like a strong student in even 201. Um, but then like as I progressed through the major, I just felt like I wasn&#39;t finding the support I needed. I wasn&#39;t feeling like, like professors, like I wasn&#39;t, I didn&#39;t, I haven&#39;t connected with anyone, any professor in the Department, Computer Science Department because they&#39;re always so busy. Like I felt like literally like I felt like I was always playing catch up. Like I felt like, and like for for me that especially got super damaging with 310 and 330 because like I had to kind of--cause like I think with compsci I like if you feel like you don&#39;t know shit, like if you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on in class, it&#39;s like I feel like there&#39;s a pressure for you-- oh, you just have to go over the lectures again or oh you have to do work. It&#39;s not like, it&#39;s not like even though there are a lot of TA hours for compsci, I feel like it can be kind of intimidating cause other people who are there and like you don&#39;t want to seem stupid or like you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on. It can literally be the smallest thing but you don&#39;t know. I feel like definitely like for some reason I feel like it was probably like something the CS department could fix. But like when I felt like I didn&#39;t know something, I immediately isolated myself, was like let me just focus on catching up by myself, which often made me like write code that which wasn&#39;t right. Or like I would try to develop or like think about things improperly and then I&#39;d talked to the professor and the professor would be like, oh no, no, no. This is how you think about it. And it was like, like if I just sat down to have the conversation beforehand, like it would have been like, it would have erased like hours and hours of work. But like it feels like professionals are always busy. They never have time for you.

**Michelle Chen:**         My advisor, I have Astrachan, he&#39;s also like supervising the study, but I think he has so many students that he&#39;s scheduled like literally 5 to 10 minute increments.

**PM:**         And like that&#39;s so stupid. Literally like, like, this is a problem because I&#39;m, I&#39;m a planning student. So I had my, I had my four year plan for the major when I was in sophomore year. But for students who don&#39;t do that, like it feels, it feels like computer science as a major doesn&#39;t support like people who are kind of thinking about it or there&#39;s no mentorship. Like literally like my advisor, like I&#39;ve met with her twice and it&#39;s been 15 minute meetings and I&#39;ve kind of um, I&#39;ve known they&#39;re 15 minutes, but I&#39;ll try to keep the conversation going longer because I had-- I just have questions.  Um, but I feel like I can&#39;t--if I have questions about compsci, I don&#39;t go to the compsci department because like they&#39;re like, I feel like I don&#39;t have a relationship with them so  the advice you give me is not going to be relevant. Like I told my adviser twice that I want to do a BA. And then this semester I get an email like, oh, like Phillip, you don&#39;t have enough credits for the BS. What are you trying to do. I was like, I&#39;m kind of doing the BA. And she was like, oh, OK! And then changed it. And I like--because it&#39;s not only that we get less time but they just don&#39;t, they just don&#39;t have the capacity and like that&#39;s a huge problem because like I don&#39;t even know how they can fix it because honestly they just need to make the class sizes are smaller and say only this number of people can major in compsci, given the number of faculty members because otherwise people just keep having shitty experiences and like, yeah, like I don&#39;t like I don&#39;t feel like--I can&#39;t even tell you what I really learned in compsci, like I don&#39;t know, like

**Michelle Chen:**         That&#39;s how I feel. I feel like I&#39;m graduating and like I can make you hangman if you give me like three days or something.

**Michelle Chen:**         So yeah. So that&#39;s. Oh and I want to say that if I haven&#39;t, if literally if, if 310 and like, OK, so with 310. If I didn&#39;t have Ozi I almost surely would failed that class. Because he was the one that was pushing me to like, like like talk to TAs or the professor or like, um, and I was just like, no, I just got to make time and just do it by myself do it by myself by myself. But he was like, no, Philip--if I didn&#39;t have Ozi I would&#39;ve failed that class. Honestly, I know you might not believe me on this, but that one moment in 330--I think I would&#39;ve gotten at least a very significant less grade if we hadn&#39;t had that conversation that one time in TA hours because like I like, cause I think I think--and I&#39;ve talked to you, this is this something I appreciate about you, is that like I feel like you&#39;re very forthright and honest.

**PM:**         Like when you don&#39;t know something, I think sometimes you, like you said you do this, like apologize before you even speak, but like the fact that you&#39;re willing to put your ideas out there, I definitely learned that from you. And like when I went to office hours like each other time after that, it was so much more productive because I&#39;d be like, I don&#39;t know shit. I just tell the TAs I don&#39;t know shit. I wouldn&#39;t to like front or put up BS and like say things that like made it seem like I was right. So like I guess through the hardship of the the CS department, I&#39;ve gained new skills in that regard but I definitely don&#39;t know-- I feel like anything that the classes were supposed to teach me and I feel like I feel like it hasn&#39;t been, it hasn&#39;t been an enjoyable experience. I feel like I could have grown more as a person if I just majored in something different. Like because I&#39;ve found so much more support from the math department, the um, cul-anth and like even like I have better relationships with professors in culanth department, AAAS, sociology, gender studies, like off of one class versus the ten classes I took for compsci.  And I only like one person who like I would even reach out for recommendation in the compsci department and he might not even give that to me, you know? So yeah. So yeah, that&#39;s my thing.

**Michelle Chen:**         So have you taken 308 or just 310 and 330?

**PM:**         Just 310 and 330 and 316.

**Michelle Chen:**         And so, the first question I ask is just just did you have any computer science background before you went to Duke? And like what did that look like and what were the demographics of your class? So I actually, I never took a compsci class per say, I&#39;m just like, I&#39;ve just always known that was super interested in computers and so like even from a young age, like I would build like these small html websites or like um, I like took apart a computer once and put it together but it wasn&#39;t completely. It was just, I don&#39;t know, I&#39;d pull up the RAM, like take apart the processor processor, like shit like that. Um, and so I knew I was always interested in it and I would kind of read books and sometimes  try to learn programming languages, um, but nothing&#39;s super intense. Um, but then I think the summer before my senior year of high school, I did an internship at Notre Dame and that&#39;s where I really learned C, C++, it was like a lab, um, and I was basically helping rewrite a curriculum for first year computer science students who are learning C++ and I was changing it to C, um, and so it was, um, there&#39;s just some of the basic. It wasn&#39;t like-- I definitely got like a, a firm understanding of that and I helped them with a couple of other projects. Um, so that was dope, um, yeah. And so that, and it just kind of being a tech nerd in general, just like knowing tech news, knowing at Google what projects they were working, on apple, like keeping up on news and stuff.

**PM:**         Did your parents encourage you to study CS ever? Were your parents ever like &quot;you should do this&quot; or did they more--

**PM:**         I feel like they were kind of, they weren&#39;t the ones that first pushed me to consider computer science. I had to find that on my own. It&#39;s not like they objected to it, rght. And I think that&#39;s because they heard so many good things about the industry and making money too, like OK, we&#39;re going to be set. So it wasn&#39;t, it wasn&#39;t as if--

**Michelle Chen:**         They said you need to do this?

**PM:**         It wasn&#39;t that they said I need to do this. Um, but I think yeah they just encouraged me to do it slash took advantage of me because they thought that I knew about computers and knew how to fix everything regarding the computer.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah. Interesting. And then, so we sort of talked about this, but in your classes and group work, in the compsci department or cs learning in general, who do you surround yourself with? What kind of people? Like what kind of people like demographic wise and also just like, I don&#39;t know, like I asked asked Austin this and he was like &quot;smart people&quot; and I was like OK. But like--

**PM:**         Well I mean this might not be great but I feel like if you, if you want to be successful in computer science, you have to have at least three connections to people who are male, either white or Asian or like right off the bat, I think it&#39;s been great working with Ozi because like I think we&#39;re both black and we kind of, we have some similarity but we&#39;d like to dance. And so definitely like grew this dope friendship out of that. And then both being in compsci. But like definitely like once I started aligning myself with this one, a guy who like presents his Jewish. I think he was wearing like, a Jewish star or something and this other Asian guy, Asian girl who would go to office hours all the time, and I would just text them like, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m thinking of this for my proof, this for my proof&quot;, and that&#39;s when I started doing better grade-wise. And so like-- that&#39;s kind of people you need to surround yourself with in order to be successful GPA wise. As far as who kept me sane? You and Ozi and a couple of other people who like I could just complain about computer science with and the shittiness of it and the assignments. Um, yeah. So like, like, like. Yeah, I would say that.

**Michelle Chen:**         So I guess you&#39;ve kind of answered this, but why do you think you chose those individuals? Just because you were like, they can help me get the right answer and grades, do you know what I mean?

**PM:**         Yeah, I think, yeah. Yeah. Those like, so like aligning myself with. Yeah, with men and East Asian and like white men. I think it was purely just like, let me just, um, sorry, yeah let me just align myself with people who I know are going to get me a good grade. Facts, and that&#39;s it. And I kind of feel icky saying that but like honestly my grades got better. And I was still-- in such a way that like I had more time to enjoy myself. I had more time to have social connections with other people because I feel like I feel like because compsci is so heavily white and East Asian dominated that like, like for me, who-- I&#39;m more socially mostly socially involved in black circles on campus. The social circles don&#39;t translate very quickly or at all and so so like I feel like other people benefit from social circles. Like definitely if you&#39;re in Greek life, definitely if you&#39;re like in those like ethnic backgrounds but like for me if you&#39;re in those ethnic  backgrounds and all have social circles in those ethnic backgrounds. But then for me it&#39;s just, it just didn&#39;t, it didn&#39;t translate.

**Michelle Chen:**         That&#39;s interesting because like, I mean this is just like for sake of conversation but like I actively try to not work with any Asian men because I just felt like they would like belittle me and I like I just didn&#39;t and I actually.--

**PM:**         And that&#39;s part of it and that&#39;s the part I think, I think part of me having some realizations that I had to align myself with it was I felt like I was-- I had to remind myself to be OK with feeling-- being made feel like I was stupid, like I didn&#39;t know shit, because they were going to make me feel like that.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah.

**PM:**         I&#39;m sorry. I couldn&#39;t imagine like from your perspective as like like a woman, like trying to deal with that as well.

**Michelle Chen:**         Like the reason why I liked working with people like you and Ozi would because like you said, like we&#39;re, I feel like we were all honest about where we, if we didn&#39;t know if we did, we would very much try to help each other. And I didn&#39;t feel like you ever judged me for being, for not understanding something. Whereas I felt like with with the like I&#39;m sure if I worked with the 2 Asians and the Jewish guy that you were talking about that I would feel like I was dead weight or wasting their time. You know what I mean? It&#39;s so interesting because I talked to someone else about it and she was like, yeah, I actually prefer working with people who are on my level or like dumber because she was like, we learn together and I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m playing catch up with them, which is, it&#39;s just like an interesting the difference-- because you&#39;re right at the end of the day like I just sometimes like I had to ask those people for like-- swallow my pride and ask for answers. But as far as working with people, I don&#39;t know, I was just-- they just made me feel so bad.

**PM:**         And they do and that&#39;s just facts. Cause they always give you that look like when you ask something like sometimes I know with me and this was just a general thing for me, I ask questions to clarify, but sometimes people will take that as if I just don&#39;t know anything. Then sometimes I get super frustrated because I, because they&#39;ll, they won&#39;t answer my questions, they&#39;ll answer my question and then add on the whole lot. And I&#39;m like, no, I just wanted to clarify as long as I can be confident in it.

**Michelle Chen:**         And so I guess another question I have is, do you think your experience in the CS major has been different from most females students experiences?  And if so, how?

**PM:**         I would definitely say so. I think-- how um... I feel, I feel like I think it&#39;d be like it&#39;s maybe more it&#39;s easier for me to like um just like I don&#39;t know what the term is--just like male camaraderie and just like insert myself into male circles and not necessarily feel a sense of legitimacy but like-- not even acceptance, but not, not feel like-- I don&#39;t want to say scared because that&#39;s hard, but then I feel uncomfortable I guess because I recognize that like, like because of there isn&#39;t, isn&#39;t a threat of so many other things happening by me trying to interact with this one person or a couple of people. Right? And so I feel like there&#39;s just a whole lot more questions that I would have to consider and things I&#39;d have to think about if I was a woman in computer science, especially given like the culture on campus around like gender violence, sexual assault, not even sexual assault, but just like-- cause that&#39;s like the extreme, right? But even just feeling uncomfortable like people touching, touching you in inappropriate places, making inappropriate, like, like, like just like even just texting three triple times, like that&#39;s uncomfortable. Right. And so like, um, that&#39;ll deter someone from coming to office hours. Right. And so like that, that hadn&#39;t been on my mind even. And so yeah. I think also just this might not be it be based on my, like my gender identity, but also just I feel like I&#39;m an outgoing social person, so because of that I&#39;ve been able to benefit by like just being--it&#39;s easier once I take the initiative for me to make social connections with people who know what they&#39;re doing or appear to, right?  And so, eah.

**Michelle Chen:**         I guess then kind of going off of that, does gender influence how you look at potential teammates or like people you would want to ask for help from?

**PM:**         Ohh... Uh, I think not, not consciously. So I think for me, because I knew OZI, if I ever have to pick a group mate, I&#39;m always picking Ozi even though we don&#39;t necessarily have the right-- we literally, we, I don&#39;t think we work well together. I think like we argue a lot. He always wants to work super late. I don&#39;t work super early, like not as in like early before the deadline, but I want to work like in the morning, in the morning slash afternoon he wants to work past 12 AM, 12 at night. And I just don&#39;t, I just feel as productive so we don&#39;t work well together. But like, I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s just like it&#39;s just Ozi so like immediately him. Um, as far as who I ask questions for, uh questions from, I think being completely honest, I do tend more to ask the males then females.

**PM:**         I think that&#39;s definitely a gender bias on my part that I&#39;m gonna like, cause it&#39;s brought up I&#39;m going to check that, but like I think I think I can think of specifically times in 310, um like not so much if there&#39;s a TA, so if was a female and male TA, I, it wasn&#39;t as much, it wouldn&#39;t matter to me, but if it was like, if a lot of people are struggling in the room, I was more actually more likely to ask the guy in the group versus the girl. Yeah, I definitely say that. Cause I mean I think that&#39;s also because of like who I would see talking to the most. I would just assume, oh, they must know what they&#39;re doing, so I&#39;m going to ask that person, right?

**Michelle Chen:**         And then, so I guess talking about other identity factors, so like how do you think your race or socioeconomic status has impacted your computer science education experience? Or have they?

**PM:**         I think, I think so-- socioeconomic status: definitely having a scholarship definitely helped me just because I have not had to worry or think about finances and I don&#39;t know if I could imagine having thinking about finances while also doing the compsci major. Um, I think that me being black, I think definitely the, so the social aspect, not really having a lot of other black people in the major. Um definitely only having one black computer science professor. Um, so like my sense of belonging-- I didn&#39;t feel like I belong. I feel kind of like an outsider. Um, and also I just feel like it wasn&#39;t like super overt, but I feel like people just kind of like at some points I feel like people assume that I just didn&#39;t know as much because I was black. Um, yeah. Other identity factors. I mean I definitely feel like I probably fit in more because I identify as cis-het male and I present that way.

**PM:**         Um, yeah, I feel like I&#39;ve definitely benefited from, like this is not an identity factor. But like, just like, um, I think freshman and sophomore year I was so focused on just compsci that like I feel like that set up a good base for me grade-wise that like when I have this kind of lagged off later on in my academic career, it was fine because I had the foundation. But like once I started to like learn more about my passions and realize-- because I also feel like compsci is a very totalizing major. So like if, if you&#39;re not completely committed to it is very hard to do well because  kind of want it to be the only thing you&#39;re thinking about. Um, and, and that&#39;s just so hard. So like I feel like compsci cause we know that there&#39;s so many interesting emerging applications for compsci, especially at intersections of other departments and research. But if as a sociology major, I just wanted to take a couple of conflict classes to help out, that&#39;s just not feasible or like maybe it&#39;s possible, but it&#39;s not made for that.

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you feel as if there&#39;s a community in which you&#39;re welcome in the CS department?

**PM:**         No,  I think right off the bat. Just because, just because like I&#39;m, I&#39;ve found a couple of people who I do find camaraderie that I&#39;d like to think of, like Aamir or Patricia? Sure, sure, sure. So yeah, I call her Pate, Nayib, but like as far as-- I don&#39;t feel like I belong within the larger community or like idea of like who a compsci student is a Duke? Um, and yeah, like, yeah,  I don&#39;t know what more to say about that.

**Michelle Chen:**         So I interviewed Pat for this like a couple of days ago and she told me that you-- did you start something like black CS office hours?

**PM:**         We were talking about it and it never got done--I&#39;m actually in talks with administration right now to try and build a, a black compsci group.

**Michelle Chen:**         So I thought it&#39;d be like, can you maybe talk about the motivation behind that or like like what you hope will come from it?

**PM:**         Oh yeah. So definitely I feel like so so as far as like regarding like why you don&#39;t see black students in the upper level compsci classes is definitely because of retention. So like, speaking to my experience, like I think sometimes, um, black students just are, I feel like definitely for me I felt more supported outside of compsci, than in compsci so it&#39;s just because of that. Um, and also just felt more passionate about things outside of compsci because of the support. And so if I wasn&#39;t so gung Ho on compsci the first few years, I don&#39;t think it would&#39;ve been a compsci major. Um, and so that&#39;s definitely the choice that other people are making. Like they think, oh, like they take 101 or 201 thinking, oh I might minor, I maybe be a major or double major or something else and they&#39;re quickly dissuaded from the fact because they don&#39;t have a support network specifically tailored to them and their experiences.

**PM:**         Um, I definitely, um, I&#39;m talking--so the person I&#39;m thinking about compsci group forming this with is Leila Owens, she&#39;s a sophomore.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah!

**PM:**         Wait you&#39;ve met her? Yeah, she&#39;s amazing and I&#39;m so I&#39;m looking for her so I&#39;m trying going to give advice and input and let her kind of take over. Um, but yeah, I think so, what was I saying beforehand? So she spoke about experiences of her just being a TA and she got connected with a lot of black women who were like in 101 and said that--they told her that they only felt comfortable coming to her as a TA. And so when we talk about like having like more female TAs and more black female TAs, like, it&#39;s so important for retention and the major. Um, and yeah, I think as far as motivation for the group, I just think of like how many things I just didn&#39;t take advantage of.

**PM:**         Like, because like there&#39;s so many ways of informally getting support from your friends, right? And that can be like, like answers, that could be code, that could be, &quot;hey, can you look over my code&quot;? And those first couple years I wasn&#39;t getting that outside and I didn&#39;t necessarily need that to get a good grade in the class because it has my background in compsci I could rely on. But if you don&#39;t have a background in compsci, it&#39;s really, it&#39;s damn near impossible to do it on your own. And so if you don&#39;t have networks that are helping you out and immediately from 101 or 201 then you&#39;re going to feel so discouraged versus classes where you don&#39;t necessarily feel you need a network. I feel like smaller class sizes, you don&#39;t feel necessarily feel as much of a need for like that one person in class we can get you through because you can talk to the professor more easily or like you have more time to like raise hand, give questions asks question.

**PM:**         So and so for me and for Leila, what we were just talking about, just trying to provide some sort of social network that like, or network of black students who can give advice. Like so for example, I gave my cracking the coding interview book to Leila, like shit like that. Like that&#39;s so important. Sorry, do you want me to stop cussing?

**Michelle Chen:**         No, no no.

**PM:**         Um, but like, like stuff like that, because I know that that book is $30 if she&#39;s low SES like that might be like something she has to think about. And so just the fact that I&#39;m able to take it off my hands and just give it to her. Like that can mean the world. And so yeah, it&#39;s just informal and it specifies a support. So like also talking about the INSPIRES program which is geared towards specifically retention, which is the main problem we&#39;re trying to solve and does that through specific professional trainings like um, a thousand dollars per semester, per year to do professional development.

**PM:**         And that could look like going to a conference, which conferences honestly can like really bolst someone&#39;s like, belonging in compsci like Grace Hopper, I think of TAPIA conference is so important because I know conferences that I go, I&#39;ve got to like changed my academic direction at Duke. I went to this conference in Harvard called blacktivism, met someone who was talking about a professor at Duke. Said you need to take a, like a class with this guy. I take the class. I learned about, oh, what the fuck, this is systemic racism! And so I learned what that is. And then I was like, Oh shit! And so I&#39;ve been, I&#39;ve become involved in activism on campus. Then I become involved in BSA and that&#39;s changed my life at Duke, right? And so conferences can have--even from that small interaction just like everything follows. And so, and that comes from finding your people, finding where you belong and I feel like everyone deserves to feel like that and um, don&#39;t want to necessarily say that they like, oh, like, like white men, East Asian men don&#39;t deserve it, but because there&#39;s spaces they&#39;re taking up means that other feeling that, we need to find a space for the people on the margins in other ways.

**PM:**         I think that through this compsci group we can really start to do that.

**Michelle Chen:**         That&#39;s so, yeah, that&#39;s really cool.

**PM:**         And so I&#39;m reaching out to people now trying to get feedback and try to see like, OK, like if we do make this, what specifically would people want? What would people support?

**Michelle Chen:**         Like this is my curiosity, but is there a reason why, like you said like the first few years you were like super into it and then the last few years you were kind of like, eh, about compsci. Like did something happen or was it just kind of like--

**PM:**         I just, I just realized that compsci didn&#39;t speak to my experiences as a black person. There is no way that the compsci department was addressing the questions that I was asking. And I think it was just part of that transition that just laid out between sociology, learning about systemic racism, um, I think nothing about compsci spoke to that. And so for me, a lot of my college career I would say is it has been about like, OK interrogating systemic racism, interrogating my own male privilege. So like I took a suitor studies class, like interrogating my identity. So like my dad&#39;s from the Bahamas so learn more about that. Um, nothing about compsci spoke to that and I felt like that&#39;s where I&#39;ve grown the most. Compsci, it&#39;s just the gig I have right now to get the job. First and second year, like I was passionate about compsci and still I am passionate about compsci but not in the way that the compsci department wants me to be. Like I&#39;m interested in asking the questions about compsci in like these little like, like, and being critical of tech in general about the ways in which it like, like exacerbates inequality and threatens democracy.

**PM:**         Like even like facebook, Mark Zuckerberg on the fucking podium right now trying to defend himself. Like things like that where tech is objectively making this world a worse place to live in and trying to hold it accountable to that and just investigate that more. And so that&#39;s what I want to do. That&#39;s not what the Duke compsci program is for. And so if I found a professor that kind of sent me on the right path with that, um, so I read like &quot;Weapons of Math Destruction&quot;, which is a great book, I recommend it to anyone. I have a copy if you ever want to read it, but basically it&#39;s literally about like the tagline is, uh, how um, algorithms or big data, um, threaten democracy and increase inequality. Um, so, so looking at how basically the how like algorithms are being poorly implemented and deployed, yeah. Like, um, people just trust numbers and they think they are unbiased, but they&#39;re just another way of coding bias, you know?

**PM:**         And so like, I, so if I could briefly digress, one of the examples that just comes out comes out to my mind is that like, so when we think about facebook and the data collection of data, like facebook knows based on people&#39;s posting history, what type of mood or mind state they&#39;re right. And so the, in the book it talks about for profit universities and how much of their budget they spend on advertising on places like facebook and how they and how, sorry, like how I just feel like it&#39;s so insidious is how like for profit universities will target users particularly on facebook and maybe through other means who have recently experienced trauma because facebook knows if you&#39;ve recently experienced trauma, right? Because you make a post about it, you&#39;re talking to your friends about it on messenger, whatever, whatever. And they, they sell that data for advertisers.

**PM:**         Um, and we&#39;re talking about things like either a child passing away or losing a job or anything like that. It&#39;s devastating. And then you&#39;ll see this ad pop up like, &quot;Oh, get your master&#39;s degree in 12 months or something&quot;. Um, for, for, for a for profit university. And we know that for profit universities are only for increasing debt and like don&#39;t actually provide great education. They are considered, the degrees are actually worth less than a high school degree, like so many different things. Um, but the data that facebook collects allows for private universities specifically target people. And we could always say like, &quot;oh, they&#39;re adults they should make the right choice&quot;. But imagine that like literally someone who&#39;s trying to get you can wait at when you&#39;re at your lowest point and doesn&#39;t care and doesn&#39;t care about whether or not you just lost your job, lost a child going through a death and like anything they can just wait until you show signs of that and then hit you with the ad when you&#39;re at your most vulnerable and then you like. And I don&#39;t think people like, I don&#39;t think that should be allowed. Like I like that, that&#39;s super insidious. And like they consider things like how it data is being implemented--the book considers things like, um, so like universities. How like rankings for universities don&#39;t include like, um, like, uh, the cost of tuition. Why? Like that doesn&#39;t--one the biggest factors for so many people, but it&#39;s not included in the US news rankings or like, um, for like the justice system, there&#39;s algorithm that&#39;s supposed to score someone&#39;s recidivism rate and obviously that&#39;s like if they ask questions like, oh, has someone you known been recently incarcerated or do you live in a certain area? And so it quickly becomes racially coded and increases people&#39;s um, increases like just to be explicit-- black people. Um, um, the time that they&#39;re sent to prison for and decreases white people&#39;s time they&#39;re sent to prison for it even though it&#39;s been like the recidivism algorithm that they&#39;re using is implemented in so many courts around the nation.

**PM:**         And it&#39;s like not at all predicting or like, or like useful and it covers so many different things. Schools, like how do you evaluate teachers? Um, job, how you evaluate, employees um, like how you like try to predict crime in the area that leads to over policing of black people because like with predictive policing techniques and you don&#39;t look at like white collar crimes, you always look at like things that are more likely to happen to inner cities more likely happen to black people. But like, I mean there are white crime, white collar crime, predictive policing techniques, but like

**Michelle Chen:**         And they ignore like history, right? And like structural inequality. That&#39;s.

**PM:**         Yeah, that&#39;s all what the book&#39;s about. And those are the questions I want to study for the rest of my life. That&#39;s the kind of activism I want to do. The solutions I want to build, use software to solve. Right? But that&#39;s not what the compsci department is for here.  That&#39;s why you see kind of a dropping off.

**Michelle Chen:**         That&#39;s really interesting. That&#39;s interesting. That&#39;s a great reason to be less.

**PM:**         I can, I can like give you the, if you want to read the book and I can give you the book. I can also have-- I have a list of twitter people who I follow who talked about that on the daily.

**Michelle Chen:**         So I guess now I want to sort of ask you about

**PM:**         Oh shit what time is it?

**Michelle Chen:**         Do you have to go?  4:35.

**PM:**         I&#39;m fine. I have, I have, I&#39;m performing tonight for--you&#39;re in it?

**Michelle Chen:**         Yes you saw me! I waved at you yesterday.

**PM:**         Oh yes! Wait, you&#39;re in the Tommy DeFrantz?

**Michelle Chen:**         Yes. I can&#39;t dance. So like it&#39;s just like a little bit. I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m just like kinda--I feel like I have stage fright and also like my friends are going and it&#39;s just like

**PM:**         Sorry.

**Michelle Chen:**         You know what I mean? Like I don&#39;t know--are you nervous?

**PM:**         Yes!

**Michelle Chen:**         Really? But you guys are so good. Like that&#39;s the thing that you guys are good and I&#39;m like I&#39;m pretending to be a toaster. Like it&#39;s different.

**PM:**         Like wait, I need to watch yours, you&#39;re being a toaster? I want to watch it please. Wait do you know Eliza Moreno?

**Michelle Chen:**         Yeah!

**PM:**         Do you hang out with a lot?

**Michelle Chen:**         So she&#39;s really good friends with Carlos so I like to see her but I don&#39;t hang out with. Why?

**PM:**         I just feel like a lot of your mannerisms are just reminding me a lot of Eliza.

**Michelle Chen:**         Really? I&#39;m like, so like my friends are like, yeah we&#39;re going to come and record it and I&#39;m like... at one point we pretend like we&#39;re in the shower and then like at the end we do a, we pray to the audience that they like reduce their energy consumption. Just  yeah, we like do a prayer.

**PM:**         It&#39;s interesting

**Michelle Chen:**         It&#39;s very cool. Conceptually like I would like to watch professionals do it, but it&#39;s like basically what it is is like a bunch of people who need extra credit for the class. So it&#39;s like people like 12 people who can&#39;t dance and like we&#39;re all onstage.

**PM:**         Yeah but Tommy DeFrantz is like all about that conceptual shit.

**Michelle Chen:**         He&#39;s so cool.

**PM:**         He&#39;s very dope, I&#39;m in his class right now.

**Michelle Chen:**         He&#39;s just like-- Michelle! More confidence and I&#39;m like I would be confident if I could dance, but I can&#39;t. So wait when do you have to get there?

**PM:**         At five, 5:30 maybe. I don&#39;t know.

**Michelle Chen:**         OK. OK. Well specifically, um, so in 310 and 330 you already sort of talked about your experiences in them, but I guess one question I had was like how could it have been better? Like how could your experience have been better at besides--

**PM:**         I think there just needs to be a like a compsci course on like how to work in group projects and not 308, cause that&#39;s too much stress but like something that teaches you, like not through building a project but I just feel like good etiquette to working collaboratively because currently like so much of the curriculum is like don&#39;t cheat, don&#39;t like steal somebody else&#39;s code, don&#39;t work with others. But then like literally when I go like I&#39;m working at Appian in Reston Virginia and like literally it&#39;s like pair programming and like working on the scrum team and like that&#39;s I&#39;m going to be literally be able to ask like, hey, how did you do this? They&#39;re not gonna care about like evaluating like, oh did Nill do this code or did you do this? They&#39;re just going to care If it works, right? And so like I feel like having a class, like I want, I could argue like I want the evaluation technique of the entire department to change.

**PM:**         But I think purely just having a class talking about like &quot;OK, what are good collaboration practices&quot;, but just go a long way and make it like something that freshman or sophomores take um, like, and not as an additive I&#39;d want it to be like you can take 101 or this other class or something like that because like I don&#39;t want to add more to the compsci major, it&#39;s already too big. But like something like that because I feel like so much of what went wrong for me in 310 is like I just didn&#39;t know how to hold people accountable. I didn&#39;t know how to like collect--there was just like a senior in my class who just literally didn&#39;t do anything and I&#39;m a senior now and I just know I would, I would almost do the same thing that he did. Right. But like, but like I know that like also like if I maybe had a class like how to do better collaboratively that would have been gone leaps and bounds.

**PM:**         And like as far as 330 as far as the 310 and 3:30 I feel like-- and even in more classes I feel like there should be um, like more communication on how long things should take people to complete because like even like once one a person gave a cop out, they said like, oh well, like I can&#39;t really say because if you have bugs this, it could take forever. Right. But like, like literally, literally like in 330, I watched into the professor, cause I hadn&#39;t, I didn&#39;t turn in two of the homeworks and I was like Yo, I need to figure some way to get homework done and like do better in this class. And I asked him like, how long do you expect us to be like working on these homeworks? He said five hours. Each homework was only supposed to take five hours. And I so much I spent like, like each week was almost like 15 hours.

**PM:**         I was like, shit, so I must be doing something wrong. I thought it was normal because people complain about compsci, how much work it is. I was like, oh maybe I&#39;m not spending enough time. He says, no, like it should only take five hours. And like he said like, yeah, just come to the office hours, make sure you come to office hours and I&#39;ll just like and when I started coming to office hours, he literally walks you through it, like at least gets you started. He won&#39;t give you like the crux of the problem but like literally like we would  a couple people--Jewish guy and Asian male and female-- would go to office hours and afterwards we would talk about a bunch of ourselves and we get the answers and that was the time that I was sending you the homework early. Like that&#39;s what was going on.

**Michelle Chen:**         I was like what happened? What changed?

**PM:**         And so and so I wish like every class kind of talked about like, Hey, like this is how long you should be working on this? If you&#39;re working, if you&#39;re spending so much extra time, come see me. We can talk about strategies because I feel like I thought it was normal for me to be spending so much time but it really wasn&#39;t. And I feel like professors don&#39;t understand that and they don&#39;t communicate that to students because the student to faculty ratio is so big, student feel like they can&#39;t really ask because the student population is so big. And so I feel like that would&#39;ve been super helpful for 310 too because I feel like, I thought the pro, the process or the assignments werre going to take less time than they actually did and yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         And then they took fucking forever.

**PM:**         Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:**         Um, so this is my last question, but what could the CS department do better or like, do you have any problems? Like any, anything else you want to say? Sort of like, cause basically like I, I really do want to give them a document that&#39;s like, here are the tangible things that like people think you could do better or like things that people want you to change.

**PM:**         So, off the bat, a course on collaboration, bam. I think like making professors like have an idea of how much time it&#39;s going to be taking so like those two things. I think um, I would say specific supports for people who belong to marginalized identities within computer science. And so I specifically think of women are non-gender conforming folks in computer science, either reaching out to them and seeing if they want a mentor giving them a mentor or like a funding the conferences or like, um, what else I was thinking something else, even like a specific tutor if they can pay for that. Um, that&#39;s like I, I honestly would like to see like a specific, um, TA hours for women. I think that&#39;s more achievable than specific TA hours for black people, like black students. I think that like there aren&#39;t enough to support that, but there&#39;s probably, there&#39;s probably enough women in the computer science department where I think that that would go a long way.

**PM:**         I think for black students, have a CS club. Um, and I would like to see something for Latino students as well, I haven&#39;t even talked to them to know what they would want. Um, I think honestly just adding more professors, I feel like so much, so much of the symptom is that pressure just don&#39;t have time to interact with students or to properly advise them. Like 15 minute advising meetings is not sustainable. So many people that like I, I kind of shudder to think if I didn&#39;t research and looked at like how many people went on medical leave or like leave from the university or like didn&#39;t finish the major or like um, who like ended up failing classes is because they&#39;re just not being advised properly by the compsci department to know, like, because some people like, cuz I actually only this person at UNC she was so gung-ho and into compsci and I like a lot of what I was telling you about.

**PM:**         She just didn&#39;t get it and I was like, no, the compsci-- I didn&#39;t want to say compsci is not for you, but like you&#39;re not going to get support from the department and like you&#39;re struggling too much and like no one&#39;s going to support you and I don&#39;t want your GPA to like-- so find something related. So she switched, like journalism studies does like website design a little bit. Um, something kind of related. But like I feel like that should be an advisor&#39;s job is to tell somebody that. Right? Um, yeah, I would just, I just want to see like more more diverse faculty. Um, and just what else?

**Michelle Chen:**         Like what about retention? Like how do we keep people--

**PM:**         Like this, there&#39;s this ASPIRE program already. I think it&#39;s going to be expanded to computer science and so I&#39;m encouraged by that.

**Michelle Chen:**         ASPIRE?

**PM:**         ASPIRE, it&#39;s like stands for something, but it&#39;s basically to--

**Michelle Chen:**         And it&#39;s Duke specific?

**PM:**         Yeah, it&#39;s to increase, um, retention for minority students in STEM. So they started with the math department and then now they&#39;re moving to compsci.

**PM:**         Um, yeah, I would say a more diverse course offering and the less strenuous curriculum I&#39;ve, this is one idea I think it would be super dope is for them to, instead of requiring um like 310 and 330, I would say then to have like pick two of the four 300 classes so you can either take 308, 316, 310, or 330 and you would just pick two of those and those are your major because like, um, I super enjoyed my database class--I enjoyed my database class more than my other classes and I enjoyed ultimately I feel like I learned more from-- I liked the content of 310 more than 330. And so like I feel like um, that would have like more choice. I think it&#39;s, this is all contingent on having more faculty. Right? Because I want, I would want to see like more tracks so like more like people who want to move to databases that track or like AI that track?

**PM:**         Now right now I really have like one off courses I feel like maybe I want to see more intersections with humanities. For me particularly. I remember talking to Jeff Chase and he was talking about how like he thinks are among the duke compsci professorss, they think that they&#39;re one one of the most interdisciplinary compsci departments in the nation but because they do stuff with like Econ, Bio and Neuro, right. But I&#39;m thinking of humanities so I&#39;m thinking about like, like, like cultural studies. So even like the 342 class, like that was just some BS like, like it was, it was. I don&#39;t feel like anyone learning anything tangible from that. It was one off. It wasn&#39;t-- it was because it was taught by professors who don&#39;t study that. So they didn&#39;t prioritize it that don&#39;t think it&#39;s important Azhar just made into a class to learn um like soft skills for like the tech industry. Right. And that&#39;s not why I took the class. I took that class to actually critique like tech and so I think, yeah, obviously wanting some more classes around that.

**Michelle Chen:**         Um, yeah, those are good answers.

**Michelle Chen:**         So the last thing is any, is there anyone else I should talk to?  So Leila, would be a good person?

**PM:**         Leila would be a great person.

**Michelle Chen:**         I haven&#39;t reached out to Aamir yet I should do that.

**PM:**         Aamir? Yeah yeah yeah.

**PM:**         I don&#39;t know, Ozi maybe. I&#39;m not sure if he&#39;s thought about it a lot. Stanley Yuan also Carolyn, she guided her last year.

**Michelle Chen:**         Yao? Yeah I know her.  OK. Thank you for doing this, truly.

<details><summary>Interviewee - CT2 </summary>
<p>

**Michelle Chen:** Um, but, so-- I did explain the project to you. Um, I guess if-- well, the first question is what year [are] you at?

**CT:** I am a senior.

**Michelle Chen:** Also, wait. I don&#39;t know if I said this, but everything that you say is confidential and, also, this is just because I tried to do an interview where I typed everything that they&#39;ve decided.

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** And it was like kind of awkward.

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** Like it didn&#39;t feel like a conversation. So, then I was like, &quot;I&#39;m just going to talk.&quot;

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** But **308** , **330** , **310**. Which of these have you taken? In what order were they taken in?

**CT:** Um, I took **308** in my sophomore spring. **310** abroad and then **330** I took my fall, sorry, senior fall.

**Michelle Chen:** Senior fall. Okay. Um, so did you have any computer science education prior to attending to?

**CT:** I did a little bit. I took an intro computer science class my junior year of high school.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** And it was kind of just like HTML, CSS, a little bit of, like, um, data base stuff and SQL.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** But that&#39;s it. And then, my senior year of high school I took-- like, my school didn&#39;t have AP classes but it kinda had like AP equivalent so I took the equivalent of like AP CS when I was a senior in high school.

**Michelle Chen:** Okay. And then what did the demographics of those classes look like?

**CT:** I, for sure, I remember them being like-- I mean, maybe I don&#39;t remember too much about the one I took junior year, like it might&#39;ve been a little bit more equal because it&#39;s just like introductory of like-

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Kind of web development. But, for sure, I remember distinctly my-- my senior year, it was like all guys, it was me, [Corinne] and one other-- and two other girls in the class of like-

**Michelle Chen:** Of how many?

**CT:** Twenty.

**Michelle Chen:** Twenty?

**CT:** Personally, that, that was it.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah. And then, do your family and friends encourage you to study computer science?

**CT:** Um, do they encourage me? I mean, when I was in high school I feel like my parents were definitely more like STEM, like just in general.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Kind of thing. And I-- I like kind of did identify as like, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m good at, like, math and science&quot; kind of thing. Um, but at the same time I was kind of like a pretty well-rounded student. So, I was like, I remember when I was graduating from high school, my-- my English teacher was, like, distraught that I was going into STEM fields because he was like, &quot;You could&#39;ve been an English major&quot; and blah, blah, you know, kind of thing. But, I would say my parents, I think, geared me-- like steered me towards STEM more. And um, so then my guidance counselor, at some point in high school, maybe it was junior or sophomore, something like that, was kind of like, &quot;Why don&#39;t you think about, like, engineering?&quot; Or whatever, because I was more like mathy and sciency.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** And at that point my brother was a freshman in college, I guess. And he was studying mechanical engineering and, so, my parents too were like, &quot;Yeah, why don&#39;t you start exploring, like, engineering?&quot; Or whatever. So, I did like a summer camp for, like, girls in engineering.

**Michelle Chen:** Before? You?

**CT:** Before. It was like, it was like my soph-- like, my sophomore summer.

**Michelle Chen:** Okay.

**CT:** Of high school. Um, but, as-- so-- Are you asking right now or like-?

**Michelle Chen:** No, no. No. Just, like, keep going, would you?

**CT:** Yeah, but yeah, so I-- I guess that was kind of how I started, like, going into more like tech or, like, whatever.

**Michelle Chen:** Okay.

**CT:** Um, and then, by the time that I, like, was applying to colleges, um, I think I was pretty, like, set. Like I knew I wanted to do CS.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Because I enjoyed, like, the CS classes that I took my junior year. I was in a CS class, like, my senior year. I liked it. And, I knew that I didn&#39;t want to do engineering because, like, I did that engineering camp or, like, whatever, and I was kind of, like, not really into the, like, I don&#39;t know, building like bridges or like, whatever, kind of thing.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Like it just didn&#39;t really interest me that much. So. But I thought, like, computer science was cool and I felt like, not that-- I don&#39;t know if my parents ever explicitly said so, but I did definitely, like, have the sense that, like, you know, my parents are immigrants from, like, a third world country. Like I had to do something that was gonna, like, make-

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah, yeah.

**CT:** Money. Um, and so I was thinking-- I was not, you know, thinking anything about like pre-med and you would never be, like, a doctor kind of thing.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** I wasn&#39;t really super interested.

**Michelle Chen:** But they never said, like, &quot;We want you to do computer science?&quot;

**CT:** I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s-- um-- I like-- it&#39;s hard for me to remember. I feel like it&#39;s definitely possible that-- not-- not computer science but they were definitely like &quot;You should consider, like, engineering&quot; or something like that. And it was kind of, like, they didn&#39;t have to push me [with,] like, computer science or anything because I was like compliant. Like, I was like &quot;Okay,&quot; like &quot;If I have to do engineering, I&#39;m not going to do, like, whatever.&quot;

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** [inaudible], mechanical, whatever. So, &quot;Computer science looks cool&quot; or, like, whatever. And I just kind of like, &quot;What was it?&quot; They didn&#39;t have to, like, quote unquote, like, push me. But I-- I-- I definitely like think they steered me in that direction, in that path, for sure.

**Michelle Chen:** Um, so, in your classes, in group work, in research experiences or just general CS learning, who do you surround yourself with?

**CT:** Um, I, honestly don&#39;t have that many, like, CS friends. Well, I don&#39;t know, sometimes I say this and I&#39;m like, &quot;Wait, I actually do know a lot of people in CS.&quot;

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** I mean, I don&#39;t know. I guess I don&#39;t, like, feel part of, like, the CS community, kind of in the sense that, like, I was, like, super turned off by, like, the [Hack Duke], like, kind of like community.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** I&#39;m not involved in, like, [choir] with women or, like, anything. Um, and, like, when I go to my CS classes it&#39;s always been like I&#39;ve been in my CS class with, like, the two or three people that I know, kind of thing.

**Michelle Chen:** Uhu.

**CT:** Like my-- my freshman year. I guess, maybe my freshman year I knew a lot more C-- and I-- I knew a lot more people at least taking CS because, like, my roommate, like, was taking it with me and like we sat together in class and, like, there was some other people in, like, my dorm. I remember into [one] specifically, there were like six of us in my freshman dorm that like, w-- like we&#39;re always. Like we would sit in my room, like I had this huge room and we would sit in my room on Fridays and, like, just quickly submit, like, our quizzes or like whatever, like, um, all together. Um, but I-- I think like since then, like I&#39;ve only, like, I have my sister like in all of my CS classes and that&#39;s kind of like it.

**Michelle Chen:** Who you work with.

Colette TorresYeah.

**Michelle Chen:** So, I guess, why do you think you&#39;ve chosen those individuals to surround yourself with?

**CT:** Um, yeah, I mean, so, like Corinne is my sister, my twin sister.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** So it&#39;s, like, easy to work with her. Like, we kinda had like the same base of knowledge, like the same way of, like, attacking problems and stuff like that. So, it&#39;s easy to, like, kind of like bounce ideas off of each other. Um, but I guess, as for the other people in CS, like, I definitely think it&#39;s-- it&#39;s been useful to have, like, friends in CS.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Um, but it&#39;s, I think, always been more of a thing where it&#39;s like, like maybe we initially became friends because, like, we-- I don&#39;t know if we became friends, like people like, I don&#39;t know, I guess like you, for example, like I know you through like Corinne and CS kind of thing.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Um, but I&#39;ve-- I&#39;ve always felt like more like our friendship is not because we&#39;re both in CS, it&#39;s because, like, something else.

**Michelle Chen:** We [inaudible] get along, yeah.

**CT:** Like some other factor.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah, yeah.

**CT:** But so, I guess like I do su-- I would su-- I only surround myself by people in CS who I&#39;m, like, genuinely like friends with, not just like class friends with.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah, yeah. That makes sense. Um, and then, do you think your experience in the CS major has been different than most male students&#39; experiences?

**CT:** Um, yeah. I&#39;d like to so I would say yeah, because I like-- I think for sure my freshman year, like, was when I felt it, mostly the imposter syndrome thing.

**Michelle Chen:** Uhu.

**CT:** Like, I remember I did HackDuke and I was on a team, there were four of us, right? And I was the only girl, so it was three other guys and I just felt like, &quot;oh my God,&quot;

**Michelle Chen:** Uhu, [inaudible].

**CT:** Like &quot;what, what is going on?&quot; Like &quot;What are they talking about?&quot; Like, I, like, went into it, like, feeling like I was privileged to, like, be on this, to have been asked to like be on this team with them kind of thing.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Because I felt like I was, like, inadequate, right? Like, I felt like they had much more experience, which I think they did because it&#39;s like, it was like Patrick Grady, Paul [inaudible] Harvey.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

**CT:** Like, you know what I mean? Like they-- they all.

**Michelle Chen:** What a team.

**CT:** Yeah, they all knew compscie, like the four.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** And, so, I felt like at such a disadvantage but, at the same time, I felt really, like, empowered, I guess, in the sense that I was-- So, the theme of HackDuke was like Code for Good. Right? And I was the one who was kind of like focusing the vision, like redirecting back to the like-- like we ended up creating an app that, like, we imagined would be used by this specific homeless shelter that one of my friends, like, volunteered at. And, so, I was always kind of like bringing them back to, like, the greater picture. Like I don&#39;t really care about these super like tech-y blah blah blah stuff. Like, let&#39;s say it&#39;s something useful, let&#39;s make something like helpful.

# **Michelle Chen:**

**CT:** That of thing. Um, but that&#39;s at-- um, like I mentioned before, I was super turned off by like the HackDuke community. Like I didn&#39;t enjoy the hacker, like, lifestyle.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Like, you know, kind of thing. I-- I&#39;m not into, like, the boys drinking like [friends].

**Michelle Chen:** Rebel.

**CT:** Like whatever, like until like  AM, like not into them using all of this jargon that I just don&#39;t know like, you know, and like sounding condescending and like superior-like.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah, tell me about it.

**CT:** So.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** I definitely, like, I feel like I don&#39;t identify with that, like at all.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah, so I guess, like within your classes or anything-- so, in-- because one of the conversations I had and [you] sort of mentioned this, is like how condescending guys are. Do you feel as though, in general, like most male students that you interact with are just like much more confident than the female students that you work with?

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah?

**CT:** Yeah, for sure.

**Michelle Chen:** That&#39;s how I feel too. And I&#39;m thinking like, I guess, why do you?

**CT:** Yeah, yeah. I think it just has to do with-- I mean, to be fair, I think that a lot of the guys in CS that I&#39;ve interacted with.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Are confident in particular because they do have, like, a lot more experience than I do.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Because they started doing it when they&#39;re younger, like blah, blah, blah kind of thing.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** And so, they do have a lot more knowledge and it&#39;s easier for them to talk, like, whatever.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** At the same time, like, I think they probably feel more like-- I guess they have an advantage too just like um, you know, with they all [inaudible] at some threshold above me, but, like--

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** They kind of have an exponential advantage in, like, accumulating more and more of this, like, cloud I guess.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Like, because, like they start there and like every-- they have a lot of, like, guy friends or like whatever who are also like talking about like tech things, blah blah blah, with them. And so, they like build this, like.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Base together kind of thing. Um, and it&#39;s easy for them to have that confidence. That said, if I&#39;m thinking about like, maybe, like at least one guy that I know who, like, didn&#39;t enter, like, college with any like compscie experience. I wouldn&#39;t say he&#39;s as, like, egotistical.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Kind of like condescending as like some of the others, yes, males that have interacted with. But, I do still think, compared to, like, girls I know who have no basic knowledge, like he is still more confident or at least he presents that way.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Like he&#39;s not as willing to, like, show his weaknesses in CS.

**Michelle Chen:** Really? Like, what do you mean? So, he just doesn&#39;t.

**CT:** Like--

**Michelle Chen:** When he doesn&#39;t know something.

**CT:** Yeah. Like I feel like if he doesn&#39;t know something, he&#39;ll, like, sit there and just, like, deal with it himself instead of, like, asking questions or like whatever, because he doesn&#39;t want to show that he doesn&#39;t know anything.

**Michelle Chen:** Interesting. That&#39;s never been my approach, clearly. Um, and so, I guess, sort of going off from that, in what ways has your gender impacted your experience as a CS major?

**CT:** Um, I guess for me, like, it-- it truly did, like, create a lot of imposter syndrome for me when I was first starting off because I felt like, like all of these guys around me, like especially with that HackDuke experience, like they just know so much, they have so much passion for this, like whatever, like they live and breathe code in a way that I really did not.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Like I&#39;m someone who&#39;s like, I&#39;m like, you know, I&#39;m really into fashion, I&#39;m really into art. I&#39;m into design, blah-blah-blah food, with-- whatever kind of thing. And they always felt like I had these, quote unquote, like girly traits that, like, I didn&#39;t identify with, like, the community of, like, computer science students that I saw at Duke. Right?

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** And so I-- I felt like &quot;I don&#39;t fit in here, I don&#39;t belong here.&quot; And I-- I remember freshman year in particular I felt a lot of pressure to be doing, like, side projects.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Um, in order to get, like--

**Michelle Chen:** Internships and things like that.

**CT:** Yeah, internship experience or even just to, like, fit in more or something like that in computer science. And I was like, &quot;but I literally don&#39;t have an interest in that.&quot; Like I would-- I would rather spend my time, like, volunteering, playing tennis, cooking, whatever, like, you know.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Whatever it was, like, I just didn&#39;t-- like, code wasn&#39;t my life in the way that I felt like it very easily was for all of these, like hacker-type of boys.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah. And so, when you talk about the community, like, what do you think the community looks like to you?

**CT:** Um, to me, honestly like, if I&#39;m thinking about it in my head I&#39;m thinking of, like, a very stereotypical, like-- like, honestly like Asian boys, like staying up at night, like in [The Link] or like though, what&#39;s the new one across from?

**Michelle Chen:** What, [The Postal] or [The Edge]?

**CT:** The Edge.

**Michelle Chen:** The Edge.

**CT:** They&#39;re like The Link or The Edge. Like, staying late until, like, you know,  AM, like whatever. Just like kinda like hacking away at their computers.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Um.

**Michelle Chen:** Interesting.

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** Interesting. Um, so then, does gender influence how you see teammates?

**CT:** How I see teammates?

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Like?

**Michelle Chen:** So, like, I guess, when I thought of this question, I was sort of thinking about how, like, I prefer working with other women because I feel like I can ask them questions.

**CT:** Mhm.

**Michelle Chen:** But when I generally-- I do think I have like implicit biases, in which I automatically assume that, like, a guy knows more.

**CT:** Mhm.

**Michelle Chen:** Or that he&#39;s more confident or that he&#39;ll be able to sort of, like get-- &quot;get whatever we want working to work.&quot;

**CT:** Mhm.

**Michelle Chen:** Which is, you know, versus, like, when I think about girls I&#39;m just more like &quot;they&#39;re going to be much more supportive.&quot;

**CT:** Mhm.

**Michelle Chen:** Does that make sense?

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** Like [serious] observations?

**CT:** Yeah. I mean, like, I feel like I would be, like, if I went through a [waiter] or whatever and it was like the random group assignment, I was always nervous that I would, like, end up in a team of like super hack-y, like condescending guys or whatever.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** And if there were girls in my team I would feel much more, like, confident.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Like I would be-- I don&#39;t think, no. There was never a situation in which I was the only girl, um, like what I went through [wait teams]. And, I would&#39;ve felt, I think, super intimidated if I had been the only girl.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah. Like I-- have you had any experiences with, like, condescending hack-y guys are.

**CT:** Mhm.

**Michelle Chen:** Or is it more just like you-- this is-- that&#39;s your perception of like what people--?

**CT:** Yeah, I mean, I honestly-- it&#39;s hard for me to remember it because I honestly have, like, felt so removed from, like, the CS community here at Duke. Like, I think the most immersed in that I was, was when I was a freshman.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** And the thing is like, like a lot of the guys that I surrounded myself with were like also my friends.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** So I do remember like having, like, conversations with them about this, like, you know, like, I mean for sure, like some of my friends, like, inadvertently have been, like, kind of like condescending in the way, like, they would try to, like, explain things or like whatever.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Um, and like sometimes, every once in a while, I feel like I would like to call them on their bullshit or like whatever. Um, but I feel like because I don&#39;t, like, hang around much, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve ever personally, like, experienced it beyond, like, friends who, like, do it kind of--

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah, like what do they say to you? Just like the way they explain things like?

**CT:** Yeah, just kind of like-- I don&#39;t know. Well, one part of it is, maybe, also, like, just a me-thing, like when I feel like they&#39;re using all these, like, big words, I&#39;m like, &quot;I don&#39;t understand.&quot; Like, &quot;why are you--?&quot; like, you know, like why you&#39;re-- you&#39;re like, still like, I don&#39;t know, in your mindset of like aloofness? Like, you know?

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Like you&#39;re not, like, you&#39;re just trying to sound smart right now or something like that. You&#39;re not actually, like, really helping.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Because, like, you&#39;re not like, so, you know.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** When you get out for me kind of thing. Um.

**Michelle Chen:** What do they say?

**CT:** I don&#39;t know. Like, just like talking about all of these tech concepts and stuff that like I--

**Michelle Chen:** No, but like what do they say when you say it to them?

**CT:** Oh, oh. Oh. I mean, like.

**Michelle Chen:** Or how do you call them out?

**CT:** Like, I don&#39;t know, like if I&#39;m thinking about like Patrick or something, like he&#39;d probably be like, &quot;oh, you don&#39;t know what that is?&quot; Or like something that, you know?

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** And he&#39;s kind of-- like, doesn&#39;t have the best social cues, like, you know, kind of thing, where he&#39;s pretty blunt and like whatever. Um, so I don&#39;t think he means like malice, but it&#39;s very clear that he&#39;s, like, shocked that I wouldn&#39;t know something, like, you know, like kind of thing. Um, and like I know-- I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re planning on talking to Coreen.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah, yeah.

**CT:** But I feel-- I feel like, for sure, like I witnessed him and her, like they had a huge blowout fight one time because he felt like she wasn&#39;t doing, like, enough legwork, like she would just keep on--

**Michelle Chen:** For what?

**CT:** For compscie projects or something. Like, we were like in [**250**] or something like that.

**Michelle Chen:** Oh, okay.

**CT:** And it would be like, he was like, &quot;you keep on asking me questions but you&#39;re not actually trying,&quot; like something like that, you know, it kind of thing. Um, and they like had a huge, like, fight about it because she felt like he was being super, like, condescending and rude.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Um, but I don&#39;t know, like I really, I really struggled because I-- I honestly, purposely, kind of like removed myself from, like, being surrounded by CS people.

**Michelle Chen:** Because they make you feel worse about yourself?

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** Because you don&#39;t--

**CT:** Yeah, because I don&#39;t-- like I hate feeling like-- I hate feeling like an impostor and, like I said, I don&#39;t truly like identify with, like, computer scientists in general.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** So I just-- it&#39;s my choice to, like, not continually subject myself to the feeling of being on the outside. Do you know what I mean?

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah, I totally feel, yeah, very much so.

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** Um, so, how do you think your race or socioeconomic status, or other identity factors, besides gender, have impacted your experience?

**CT:** Uh. Um, this is [just closer]. I mean, I-- I feel like-- this might be super tangential and it&#39;s kind of weird, but honestly, like I feel like since I&#39;ve come to college I&#39;ve kind of struggled with this, like, Asian identity.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Like I think I embraced it a little bit more when I was, like, in high school.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** But I was never friends with, like, Asians. Like there were-- there were Asians. I [got to] grew up right outside of Manhattan. It was like an affluent community.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Like a lot of people, like, striving to like get a good education kind of thing. So, there were Asians, but I just never hung out with them. They were like in all of my classes and I was like friendly with them and I do know that, like, I identified with them to an extent that we would always joke about like college apps or like whatever.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Because we kind of, like, we&#39;re in this like elitist. Like we&#39;re the--

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Like where-- where the other students, like-- we know we&#39;re going to do well kind of thing.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** But then-- but like, outside of like classes or whatever, all my friends were white, like, literally, every single one of them.

**Michelle Chen:** Really?

**CT:** I was in-- I had a friend group of like [tall] people. They were all white.

**Michelle Chen:** And was Coreen in that?

**CT:** Yeah, and Coreen. Um, and so I never, like, really thought about myself as Asian in high school.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** And then coming to college, like, I felt like I didn&#39;t want to be [pigeoned] in with, like, the Asians.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Um, because, like, I guess I would see a lot of like, I don&#39;t know. For whatever reason, my-- my orienta-- like freshman year orientation week, like I was friends with this, um, like Chinese girl and she was friends with like, entirely, like all these Chinese people.

**Michelle Chen:** Uhu.

**CT:** And I was just like, I don&#39;t know. Like I-- I remember feeling, like, kind of like overwhelmed that I was, like, suddenly, like, part of this group.

**Michelle Chen:** Uhu.

**CT:** And I was like &quot;I don&#39;t, like, want to be, like, stereotyped as like Asian&quot; or like whatever.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah, I totally. Yeah.

**CT:** Um. And so, I kind of like extricated myself.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** I mean, to begin with, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve necessarily gotten along with them anyways. Like it was just kind of, like, out of convenience.

**Michelle Chen:** Convenience, yeah. Definitely.

**CT:** But um, but so-- so, like in CS, like I know, like, I&#39;ve not wanted to be part of that, like Asian, like CS crowd, like kind of thing.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Um, like I&#39;ve wanted to be one of the, like, cool, like, CS students.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah. So, I guess--

**CT:** You know?

**Michelle Chen:** I mean, that&#39;s a really interesting point because I feel-- I&#39;ve felt very similarly to you. But, so do you feel like you&#39;ve isolated yourself then for a couple of reasons? Like, first, you don&#39;t want to feel like an imposter but, second, you don&#39;t want to be lumped in with like the rest of the Asian crowd?

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** Like, those are both contributing factors, you would say?

**CT:** Yeah, I-- I mean, like yeah, I would. I would say so because, like, I mean, one for me, like I said when I think about computer scientists, I think of those, like, Asian nerds.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm, yeah.

**CT:** Like whatever kind of thing, right? And so, they are the ones who I feel like make me feel-- No, I don&#39;t know that if I interacted with enough, like, frat boy, like-- like white frat boy, like CS, they also really turned me off.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm, yeah. Yeah.

**CT:** Like, I mean not that I&#39;ve necessarily been in group projects with them, but I see-- I&#39;ve fe--

**Michelle Chen:** You see their presence.

**CT:** [in **308**] especially. In **308** , like, I would see the way.

**Michelle Chen:** Like Ryan [St. Pierre]?

**CT:** Yeah, like-- like I knew about him, like, you know that kind of thing?

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Because I would hear things and like--

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Um, that DIY Joe. Or like, whatever.

**Michelle Chen:** Oh my God, [inaudible] that group.

**CT:** Yeah. Like he would-- I would-- I would be working on, like, a table, like, next to them or whatever, right? And I would just like hear the way they, like, talked to each other and like whatever. And I was just like, &quot;not.&quot;

**Michelle Chen:** And you&#39;d be like &quot;you guys are so dumb.&quot; like they so and so on.

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah, I understand that.

**CT:** Yeah, um. So, like, I don&#39;t know, they also definitely turned me off. But, um, I guess because, maybe, like what I&#39;d have more access to was, like, the Asian nerd, like ones or like whatever.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Like yeah, they&#39;re the ones who make me feel the most, like, inadequate kind of thing. Right?

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Because I feel like I can&#39;t compare to them in terms of, like, skill or expertise, or like whatever. And so, I wouldn&#39;t want to [inaudible] on myself for that reason, but also because, like, I don&#39;t want to be, like, lumped into that.

**Michelle Chen:** Into that?

**CT:** Stereotype because I don&#39;t identify with that. You know?

**Michelle Chen:** That&#39;s really-- so then, do-- you said like in college you&#39;ve wrestled more with that or like what? Like you were like &quot;oh, I, like, been thinking a lot more about my race.&quot; Like, have you reached any--

**CT:** Conclusions?

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah. Because, honestly, like I was very similar.

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** Like I grew up in Kansas and there was just like-- there weren&#39;t that many.

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** I mean, there were Asians.

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** And I&#39;d probably, like, go to Chinese school, but like, I-- a lot of my friends were not Chinese.

**CT:** Yeah, yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** And so, and then coming here I&#39;ve felt very similarly, like you want to be, like--

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** The cool Asian, you don&#39;t want to be like the nerdy Asian.

**CT:** Yeah, yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** And it&#39;s very interesting because it&#39;s also, like-- it&#39;s not like you&#39;re compromising a part of your identity.

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** But it is like, sometimes, you feel like you&#39;re hiding it. And I, also just like some people used to tell me that like I looked like I was half, or like not full, and [that I] always, like, used to be like &quot;wow, like that&#39;s such a [inaudible].&quot;

**CT:** Yeah, so.

**Michelle Chen:** You know?

**CT:** So, for me, that&#39;s actually that&#39;s an even more accurate, like, point because, so, I&#39;m Filipino, right?

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Like, I feel like when Americans think of Asians, they think of like Chinese, Korean, like whatever kind of thing. But like, I-- obviously there are parts of, like, Filipino culture that are very, like, eastern and kind of like aligned with, like that, like typical, like Asian.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** But, I mean, the Philippines was colonized by, like, Spain. Right? So, there is a lot of like my heritage or whatever that is more aligned with like Latino families, or something like that. So actually, I realized like in college, like I kind of like identify more with like the Latin American like culture.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Um, and like, I have to constantly remind myself though that I like present as Asian, like do you know what I mean? And, like, when people look at-- well, I&#39;ve had the same thing, right? Like people, like, tell me sometimes I look Mexican or like racially ambiguous, or like whatever it is.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Um, and like my last name is Torres, right? Like, I get invited to, like, minority things like all the time, um, because of my last name and-- and so like, I feel like the conclusion that I&#39;ve come to is I don&#39;t actually really identify with like, quote unquote, like Asian or like kind of like a more mainstream version of Asian.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** But I-- But I, honestly, do feel a little bit like guilty thinking that way sometimes.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Like I am trying to like escape like my heritage kind of thing.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah, I understand that. And, I don&#39;t know, sometimes I wonder if it would be different if I were-- if I looked very, like very Asian.

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** You know what I mean?

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** Like if I, because I-- I think it&#39;s always easier for me to have this sort of mindset because people are like, &quot;oh.&quot; Like they don&#39;t automatically-- or I&#39;d like to think that--

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** Like if they know me, they don&#39;t automatically group me with.

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** And even like people that don&#39;t know me, I assume like they don&#39;t. Maybe this is me giving myself too much credit. I assume that they don&#39;t just look at me and they&#39;re like-- not like, they&#39;re not just like, &quot;oh, what a nerdy.&quot;

**CT:** Yeah, yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** Compscie Asian.

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** Because I don&#39;t even necessarily view myself as presenting that way, but I always feel like I have been very, like, self-aware. Like-- or like very just like nervous of that sort of perception.

**CT:** Yeah, yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** That&#39;s a really interesting point that you bring up actually. It&#39;s been like so weird a struggle because, like, I don&#39;t want to think that I&#39;m like ashamed of being Chinese. It&#39;s more just like I don&#39;t want-- America is weird. Like--

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** White culture I think is very strange and it&#39;s like easier to find acceptance if, especially, in a place like Duke to not be like-- not even that you&#39;re ostracized, it&#39;s like you just don&#39;t want people to think of you as like a [fad], like, you know what I mean?

**CT:** Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** So interesting.

**CT:** That&#39;s for sure.

**Michelle Chen:** I actually haven&#39;t had anyone bring up a point like that. Um. People are usually just like, oh, like yeah, &quot;I-- I have money so I can get a tutor.&quot; Um, yes. So, do you feel-- You&#39;ve sort of answered this but, do you feel as if there&#39;s a community in which you&#39;re welcome in the Duke CS Department?

**CT:** Um.

**Michelle Chen:** Not just like CS but in the CS department, maybe.

**CT:** Um, I don&#39;t know. I honestly have never particularly associated myself with, like, any of, like, Duke CS departments or communities, like I don&#39;t particularly feel-- even when I was a [TA] like, you know, like you didn&#39;t particularly feel part of like that community or anything.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** I just kind of like went in, did my job, like when out, like kind of thing. Um, like I said I&#39;m not affiliated with, like, [wiring] with women.

**Michelle Chen:** With women.

**CT:** Or anything. Um, even like, you know, like [Anika] has this like Sheroes thing, or like whatever. And like, I&#39;ve known about it for years, like she&#39;s one of my best friends and like I&#39;ve participated in some of the live video chats, because she asked me to do a favor, but I have no inclination to, like.

**Michelle Chen:** Duke, yeah.

**CT:** You know?

**Michelle Chen:** I understand.

**CT:** Um, and yeah. Like I said, HackDuke was never my thing.

**Michelle Chen:** Did you ever, like, want to be a part of these communities or is it just you were like &quot;I don&#39;t see any value?&quot;

**CT:** Um, maybe my freshman year just from, like, the freshmen perspective of like &quot;I should be involved in clubs&quot; or like whatever. When I realized like I had missed like the HackDuke like [exec board application] or whatever, I was like &quot;Dammit, I wish I had done that,&quot; you know, kind of thing?

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Um, but like, I&#39;ve never liked dwelled on it.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Like I&#39;ve never thought about it more than that, like one second where I was like, &quot;oh, that could&#39;ve been an opportunity.&quot; Like I&#39;ve, like, had no interest.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** In being involved. Like, you know.

**Michelle Chen:** That makes sense. Um, so to talk [through] more about specific classes. Um, what was your experience like in **308** , **310** and **330**? Just like over a high level or just really whatever you want to talk about.

**CT:** Um, so **308**. I, like, I remember going in and everyone&#39;s like, &quot;oh my God, it&#39;s going to be the worse class,&quot; like blah, blah, blah. But I was kind of like-- I was like, &quot;no, it&#39;ll be fine&quot; because I had a lot of friends in it. Um, and so I was dismayed when I first found out that, like, it would be random groups for-- for the first two projects or whatever, because it&#39;s like, &quot;oh my God,&quot; like, &quot;who am I going to be with&quot; like whatever. But I was really lucky. Like, I ended up, like my first group is like you and [Sonia], or whatever. It was like we were all sophomores, or whatever, and we&#39;re like &quot;I don&#39;t know, it was good.&quot; And then, my second group was actually all of girls.

**Michelle Chen:** Oh, whoa.

**CT:** Which was interesting.

**Michelle Chen:** Oh, I think you told me about that.

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Um, and then-- we only have two projects, right? Three, the third was [Slogo]. I don&#39;t know who you had for it. Did you have [Olgo] for [Slogo]. Oh, the first one was individual!

**CT:** Oh, okay.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah, yeah.

**CT:** So, but there we-- there were only two teams.

**Michelle Chen:** Two. Yeah, yeah.

**CT:** Two and then the [panel]. Yeah. And then my final team, like, I really liked everyone.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** And also, all sophomores.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** And there were [like]-- there was one juniors, or something like that. But um, I really-- I actually really liked our team, like, um, it turned out really well and I had, like, some friends so it was good. Um, I do, like, remember, like, kind of like hating-- like, that&#39;s kind of a thing when I realized, in that sort of [class], that&#39;s kind of like when I-- I realized like I&#39;m not really into this like hacker, like whatever, like lifestyle.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** That&#39;s when I saw it most. I feel like it was in **308**. Um, but because I, like, had friends and like I felt like we were like in it together and it turned out to be fine. And, at the end, of the day I hated [Duvall&#39;s] style. Like, I really, I just really thought he was so condescending and did not make it very conducive to girls because, like, it&#39;s all about games. Like, you know, like-- like little things, like what the hell is a scrolling [buffer] game? Like, I don&#39;t know, like, you know.

**Michelle Chen:** [inaudible] of defense, yeah.

**CT:** Like I would have to spend time reading about games on Wikipedia before I could start the projects because, like, I didn&#39;t come in with this base of knowledge, like, you know what I mean. Um, and it was cool in the sense that it was the only class at Duke where we really, like, created something.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** But what I have necessarily wanted to create, like game platforms, no. Like, you know, like I might&#39;ve rather-- I would&#39;ve rather, like, created like a fake version of, like, Instagram or something like that. Right? Which I think is-- like, I&#39;ve seen some courses from other universities. I feel like that&#39;s just kind of the things that they do instead of like creating games. Like, you know?

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Um, and I felt like it was very obvious that he, like, hung out with like that group of Frat boys-- or like, what they would [flinch] him and they were kind of, like, his favorites. Like, you know what I mean?

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Like, um. And so, like, yeah, I didn&#39;t, I didn&#39;t [like] him at all. But I-- I do think, like at the end of the day, I kind of did enjoy that class. Like, creating those projects was like fun and I really enjoy that aspect of, like, having a tangible product at the end.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** And something that, like, you could show it. I could show, like, my aunt, who knows nothing about computer science, you know, and she&#39;d be like, &quot;Whoa, that&#39;s cool.&quot; As opposed to like whatever we do in **2** , like the [APTs], you know. Like, that&#39;s-- that&#39;s not as cool, like whatever. Even, even if it&#39;s like for us, like solving puzzles kind of like similar, like you don&#39;t have something at the end of the day.

**Michelle Chen:** A tangible thing.

**CT:** To show. Um, so I thought that was cool and-- and, when I look back on my CS career, I think that is one of the only classes that have actually been able to apply knowledge that I&#39;ve learned in the class to, like, an internship experience.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Like having learned those, like, design techniques or whatever, I was able to, like, use that more, like, in my internship. Like, I think I would&#39;ve felt really shitty if I had not taken **308** and I would&#39;ve have just produced like the grossest code, like for-- for my first internship, you know? Um, so I was glad I took it. A few times, like I said, a took [abroad] so, like--

**Michelle Chen:** Do-- like, how was it like?

**CT:** I mean like--

**Michelle Chen:** Did you [inaudible]?

**CT:** It was [pass fall], like it was in Spain. Like, um, did I like it?

**Michelle Chen:** Did you feel like you learned anything? Like, valuable or is it more just like &quot;I&#39;m glad.&quot;

**CT:** I did feel like if I had taken this class at [Duke], I probably, like, would&#39;ve learned a lot of really important information. And I remember, like, in my internship this past summer, like, I was like glad to have just taken **310** because there were a lot of concepts about like, I don&#39;t know, processors and like threading, and like parallelism and like stuff like that that I was like-- I only had like just the bare amount of knowledge about it because I took it abroad. Right? But I was like, &quot;I&#39;m glad I at least, like, had some exposure to it.&quot; Otherwise I would&#39;ve felt really stupid. Um, which I still did but-- but, um. But-- I, I definitely got the sense that it was very-- it was like important and essential kind of like information that any computer scientist should know, but I definitely did not learn enough about it at all. Um, **330** I took last semester. So, as a senior it was kind of like &quot;ugh, I&#39;m just gonna, like, do these assignments every week or whatever, just get it done&quot; kind of thing.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Um, I was like super terrified. Like, I think if I hadn&#39;t been-- like when I was thinking about it more as like a sophomore, even to some extent a junior, um, I was like terrified of the thought of **330** , right? Like, it&#39;s kind of like made out to be like the worst.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** And most impossible class you can take at Duke for CS. So, I was terrified about that. But um, I was happy that I had a lot of friends in the class. So, it felt like more manageable that way. And, at the end of the day, like it wasn&#39;t, I don&#39;t think it was the hardest, like, CS class that I took.

**Michelle Chen:** Really? What-- what class you think was hardest.

**CT:** Um, for me? I don&#39;t know why, maybe it was like I cared a lot more or something, but like, I thought to **230** was so hard.

**Michelle Chen:** What? Who did you take it with?

**CT:** Um, Bruce Donald.

**Michelle Chen:** Okay, that&#39;s probably why.

**CT:** Um, like I-- I enjoyed it, but I think like my mind just doesn&#39;t work as well with like the theoretical stuff.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Like I remember like **250** Coreen hated, but I, honestly, enjoyed **250** and like I feel like I did well in it. Like I got the concepts and I kind of had the same sense in **310** , like last-- the one I was taken-- even when it&#39;s taken abroad, like, it&#39;s hard to tell because it was like so, um, wishy washy. But like I&#39;d also had like the same thing. Um, but like for -- I think I was-- partly the reason I was terrified about **330** was because I knew it&#39;d be super theoretical, like **230** was.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** And I just, like, I hated to **230** while I was in it. At the end of the day, honestly, like, it turned out fine. Like I did well in the class, which I maybe like wasn&#39;t expecting, but also, like, I did like do the work kind of thing. It was just, I don&#39;t know, for whatever reason at the time, it felt like the most impossible thing and I, like, literally remember like crying before the final because I was like, &quot;I can&#39;t do this for.&quot;

**Michelle Chen:** For?

**CT:** For **230**.

**Michelle Chen:**** 230**. Yeah. Um, so I guess how hard was it for you to ask for help in any of these classes or did you [get] any help?

**CT:** Yeah, um. Yeah, for sure. Like, I-- I feel like I&#39;m someone who&#39;s very quiet to begin with. Like I&#39;m a very timid person. I don&#39;t like--

JasonI booked this room in ten minutes, so. So, if you guys want to [inaudible]

**Michelle Chen:** I&#39;m just doing an interview. I&#39;m just doing an interview, I&#39;ll finish in a second.

JasonWait, are you doing the thing?

**Michelle Chen:** What thing?

JasonYour-- your thing?

**Michelle Chen:** My-- what I&#39;m interviewing you guys for?

JasonYeah.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

JasonYeah, oh okay.

**Michelle Chen:** Do you guys know each other, also?

Jason[inaudible]

**CT:** I know [inaudible].

JasonSo, I&#39;m-- I&#39;m Jason.

**CT:** Hi, I&#39;m Colette.

**Michelle Chen:** Wait, so. Okay, well.

JasonI was also thinking I&#39;m crashing your guys [dinner] tonight.

**Michelle Chen:** Okay, that&#39;s fine. I&#39;m interviewing [Amir] for tonight, that&#39;s why.

JasonAnyway, [inaudible].

**Michelle Chen:** Okay, I&#39;ll be done-- We&#39;ll be done soon.

Jason[Bueno]. Hi Larry.

LarryI&#39;m just gonna drop my stuff up.

**Michelle Chen:** Okay. What do you have this room for?

JasonUm, like the project I&#39;m doing with Matt. [Inaudible]

**Michelle Chen:** Are you gonna be in here too?

LarryNo, I&#39;m just here [inaudible].

**Michelle Chen:** What if I-- Can I just sit in this room? Or do you guys need--?

JasonYeah, sure. I guess.

**Michelle Chen:** This is called inviting yourself places. Okay. We&#39;ll be done soon.

JasonYeah, yeah. Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** Bye.

JasonSee you, bye bye.

**Michelle Chen:** Okay, sorry.

**CT:** [it&#39;s alright]

**Michelle Chen:** Anyway, back for-- so like, in terms of help, [inaudible].

**CT:** Yes. I&#39;m a very timid person. Like, I don&#39;t like to like, uh, I don&#39;t like going out of my comfort zone, right? To like request like help or like whatever. Um, and I-- I definitely feel like, you know, if I was surrounded by like someone, like, like when I think of, like, my CS friends I&#39;d go to for help, it&#39;s like Patrick or like something like that. Like I-- I-- I do feel a little bit like, &quot;Okay, I need to make sure like I&#39;m not sounding stupid.&quot; Like, you know, kind of thing. Um, and so I-- like-- yeah, maybe I&#39;m a little bit hesitant because I don&#39;t like to like sound dumb and I just have this sense that, like, I don&#39;t know anything. So, like, I&#39;m gonna it&#39;d be so confused if to try to explain it anyways. So, like kind of thing.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Um, and the-- in general, I think I&#39;m someone who&#39;s very good at, like, teaching myself, like I&#39;m pretty resourceful, like on the internet or like whatever. I like to teach myself. So, um, and that sounds, I&#39;m definitely not the first person who&#39;s like gonna be asking for help.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** But at the same time, like, I was always a lot more willing to, like, go to office hours or whatever. Than, like, for example, Coreen was. I mean, I think that&#39;s out of laziness but like-- but like I would go to office hours and I would make sure I got my help that I needed, you know, like I wouldn&#39;t sit there like timid to, like, ask for the TA or something like that.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah, that makes sense. Um, I guess how could your experiences have been better in these classes?

**CT:** Um.

**Michelle Chen:** And that&#39;s a pretty broad question.

**CT:** Yeah. Um, I think for sure something that I was really disappointed with the CS department for is I feel like they are so archaic. Like, I-- I don&#39;t get the sense that a lot of my-- I-- I&#39;m positive that they&#39;re all very intelligent, very like accomplished people who know a lot about the field, but I get the sense that they&#39;re all like, I don&#39;t know. Like, for sure, very theoretical, like not-- not drawing in a lot of like super applicational knowledge.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Um, I&#39;m not very like savvy.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Like, I don&#39;t know. Like-- like I think there are ways to make compscie look like a super cool, like alluring field and I feel like, it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t see efforts, it&#39;s like the efforts that I do come off as very like cliché or like.

**Michelle Chen:** What do you mean? Like?

**CT:** Like, I don&#39;t know. Like I don&#39;t know, Sean Harper, like Susan Rogers, you know, at the end of a CS  lecture will, like, pull up some, I don&#39;t know, who, like, computer scientists and be like &quot;Look at what this woman accomplished&quot; and like blah, blah, blah. And like, &quot;I don&#39;t care.&quot; Like, you know, like it&#39;s all the kind of like old examples are super, super, like, technical examples that don&#39;t feel as accessible.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Like, you know, like if I&#39;m in CS , I don&#39;t know anything about like, probably like, machine learning, like you know, so like even though I know it&#39;s a buzzword, like, I&#39;m not going to be enthralled by seeing some random CS woman doing, like, machine learning, like, you know, kind of thing.

**Michelle Chen:** So then, what would it be someone-- What would be something that you think they could, like-- Because you&#39;re saying that--

**CT:** Yeah, so. I, like, the one class that I felt like did a really good job of making compscie look like a cool thing is CS **260** , with Alex Hartemink.

**Michelle Chen:** Oh, okay.

**CT:** Which is Intro to Computational Genomics.

**Michelle Chen:** Uhu.

**CT:** Like we would do these al-- we learned about these algorithms and all this stuff and then he&#39;d be like, &quot;Look, this is literally like how it&#39;s used in, like, genome sequencing.&quot; And like, it wasn&#39;t just like he would mention that briefly. Like, we would go into it, like, and-- and he would literally show us, like, step by step like &quot;what we just did here.&quot; &quot;Like this is how they put together the genes,&quot; &quot;This is how they blah blah blah blah.&quot; You know?

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** It was like, &quot;oh, my God. Like people are actually doing real things with this.&quot; Like, you know, like-- like basically like, I don&#39;t know if, the way-- I&#39;m don&#39;t know, I can&#39;t really-- I can&#39;t really think of an example. But like, I dunno. Yeah, I don&#39;t-- I don&#39;t know, but it was just like, it was-- it was very clear that there was like an, um, like an end-purpose to what we were learning.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** And it felt like-- like he would relate it back to also, like, Amazon or like something like-- like Amazon&#39;s, like, recommendations, [inaudible] or like something which I guess to some extent you do that a little bit in , but like, I don&#39;t know. Like-- like-- like first CS  doing like earthquake data or something like, I don&#39;t know, I was not [inaudible], it&#39;s like.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** But learning about like genome sequencing and CCS, like I was like, &quot;that is so cool.&quot;

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah, that&#39;s interesting.

**CT:** Yeah. Um, but then, like I said, something like **308** , like not applying it to like games, but applying it to like creating your own Instagram.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Or whatever, I think would be really cool. And like also, um, what was I going to say? Oh, like in like databases, for example, like all the examples are like Pokémon or something. And I&#39;m like, &quot;I&#39;m not someone who relates to that at all.&quot;

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Like, you know, um, so there&#39;s just like little things like that, like making it a little bit more, like, contemporary, a little bit more like modern, whatever.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Um, for sure. Like getting like younger, better, like professors, honestly. Um, and, also, like women, like I know that they&#39;re so proud that they like, quote unquote, doubled like-- thro-- the number of like female professors, but it went from like three to six and like only one of them really teaches, like, under-- like Susan is the only woman, for us, who really teaches undergrads. I mean, now I guess there&#39;s one other woman who does.

**Michelle Chen:** Really? I didn&#39;t really [inaudible]

**CT:** But, for like my entire, like college career, I&#39;ve only known Susan Rogers, like, you know?

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Um, and she&#39;s super [inaudible].

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Like, you know, like as someone, as a woman in CS, I&#39;m not like &quot;wow, I want to be Susan Rogers.&quot;

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Like, you know? So, just things like that. Um, and-- and yeah, just like making the classes a lot more, like, practical, I think. Um, and like also just like the electives have been so disappointing. Like one, it&#39;s impossible to get into any of them but, two, like they&#39;re just not interesting like, and they have now like special topics, like, you know, like smart phone-- mobile phone development and things like that. But, I don&#39;t know, they&#39;re not-- I don&#39;t know how successful they are because, like, I don&#39;t really know people who take them.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** You know what I mean? Um, and it would be really cool if, like, you were in a class with like, you know, like a class as big as like, I don&#39;t know, **308** or something. Right? And you are all in group projects creating, like, a phone app.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Like, I mean it&#39;s hard for me to judge this without really, like, knowing what it&#39;s about but I just-- I get the sense that like they&#39;re like flimsy, like they&#39;re not very substantial.

**Michelle Chen:** So, I guess like what other kinds of classes would you want to see?

**CT:** Yeah, just like classes that I feel like have like an application to, like, the real world. Like in-- in, like, the industry in particular. So, like, yeah, like iOS or like Android.

JasonWe&#39;re actually meeting outside, so you can just take this room for the next hour.

**Michelle Chen:** Are you sure?

JasonIt&#39;s just really beautiful outside, if you know what I mean.

**Michelle Chen:** Okay. I mean, I feel that but if--

JasonNo, no.

**Michelle Chen:** So, I&#39;m not kicking you out?

JasonYeah.

**Michelle Chen:** Okay, thanks.

**CT:** Thank you.

**Michelle Chen:** Um. Okay, interesting. Um, I could guess for me, I always wished that, like-- yeah, I agree the electives are like-- I&#39;m literally doing independent study.

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** Because I just didn&#39;t want to take any of the electives.

**CT:** Yeah, yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** I said &quot;these all seem really boring.&quot; Um, what about like-- also, this is sort of going back to what you said a little while ago, but you were like-- also when do you have to go?

**CT:** Excuse me. Sorry. Um, probably by five.

**Michelle Chen:** Okay. Um, but you&#39;re like, &quot;I never felt like I was a part of TA community.&quot; Like, did you ever want to be a part of--? Because I never really felt like I was a part of it either.

**CT:** No. I-- like, to some extent, I do feel like I&#39;m kind of-- I guess, just because like I&#39;m an ambitious person and, in general, like I&#39;m used to the idea of like networking and blah blah blah. Like, honestly, like I&#39;m coming out of here without really knowing in CS, like kind of thing. Like if I, not that this will ever happen, but like, if I wanted to like str--.

**Michelle Chen:** Do a startup.

**CT:** Like create a startup or like whatever, I wouldn&#39;t really know people--

**Michelle Chen:** To ask.

**CT:** To ask or if I even just wanted to, like, be part of one. You know, like, one of my friends was talking about, like, how he and like all of his friends, like, just randomly were asked to be part of this, like, startup or whatever, and I was like, &quot;That&#39;s really cool.&quot;

**Michelle Chen:** At Duke?

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** Is this the shipping one?

**CT:** Yeah, yeah. Yeah, [&quot;it&#39;s our mission.&quot;] Um, but like, but I was like-- I mean, I don&#39;t think the idea is good, but like, you know, like I was-- I&#39;m like-- I&#39;m-- I&#39;m like I would never be asked to do that because no one in the CS world knows about me. Like, do you know what I mean? Kind of thing. And also, I&#39;m a girl, but like.

**Michelle Chen:** You know, it&#39;s so funny. The last interview I did was with Dorothy. Do you know her?

**CT:** No.

**Michelle Chen:** She is their only female and she&#39;s they&#39;re like, um, like website, iOS, Android-- they-- she does like all the design for them and like, now, they were like, they want her to do everything in front end and they&#39;re giving her like a six percent, seven percent like equity stake and, like, [Armie] has like thirty percent. Everyone else is like twelve point five and I&#39;m just like, &quot;why are you--&quot; like, really?

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** Like why are you-- why are you letting them do this?

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** Just like [inaudible]. Also, like, I would never, I&#39;m sorry, I would want to work for Armie in my life.

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** So, that&#39;s like that&#39;s out of the questions. But yeah, I guess I-- I see what you&#39;re talking about.

**CT:** But, I mean but-- but, truly like I don&#39;t regret like not, like being part of anything.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah. You do? I mean, do you have any regrets with CS, in general?

**CT:** Um, Yeah. I think I-- I definitely kind of regret, like, falling into this mindset that, like, I&#39;m not a CS person. Like I don&#39;t really belong in this industry. Like I&#39;m just here doing it, like I&#39;m decent at it. I&#39;m not great at it. But I-- I don&#39;t know. Like, I was talking to someone about the fact that like, I-- like I&#39;m not curious about anything related to CS, you know? Like, and-- and-- and part of the problem is that because I tell myself like, you know, like I, when I was a freshman I saw, like, what the stereotype kind of like was for CS, I kind of like saw it affirmed for me. Like in-- in a lot of the people around me. And I was like &quot;Okay, should I [let] myself off from this? I don&#39;t want to be part of that, like don&#39;t feel like I have access to that community really,&quot; like kind of thing. And I kind of just got in this mindset that like, &quot;I&#39;m not in CS. CS is not truly my passion&quot; kind of thing.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Um, and now, like, I definitely, I&#39;m like anxious going into the industry because like, I never, like, have-- I hung out with like CS people or like, whatever. I don&#39;t know how to talk intelligently about, like, tech CS, like whatever topics, themes, like whatever. Um, because I just kind of shut myself out from that. I don&#39;t know.

**Michelle Chen:** Interesting. Like who did you hang out with, like, over the summer and stuff?

**CT:** Yeah. So, like I hated my TA-- I mean, I-- at the end of the day, like I was-- I was really lucky to, like have the team that I did, but um, and they were all like genuinely nice, kind people.

**Michelle Chen:** Sorry that I--

**CT:** But I really, like, felt like I did not belong in and I hated that feeling because, like, I was on a team of five guys.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Um, they were all kind of like tech bros, like literally. And it was-- it was nice. They had lunch together every single day and I was a of that, you know, kind of thing. So, they definitely, like, we&#39;re not like the anti-social, like nerds that I fear, um, but like they would talk about beer and Bitcoin, and like disc-- disc golf and like, what&#39;s it called? Rick and Morty, and like, you know, like, and I&#39;m just like-- I don&#39;t-- I don&#39;t identify with any of this.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Like, and so it was really hard for me to truly feel like I-- felt-- truly feel like I belonged there.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Um. And, I feel like-- well, so this summer I did-- I didn&#39;t really have a chance to interact with a lot of interns because I was in a smaller office. But I feel like, in general, like-- like, I mean I was working at a big tech company, right? Like, so a lot of those people are super, like, compelled by like tech and whatever. And I feel like they could all handle themselves in those situations. And, like, if they were together, they would be talking about, like-- if I went to like a party or like whatever, like outside of work, um, it would be all tech interns, right? And they&#39;d be all talking about, like, their jobs that Pinterest, Facebook, blah, blah, blah, Uber, whatever, and I was just like, &quot;oh my God, get me out of here.&quot; Like, &quot;I hate Silicon Valley.&quot; Like, you know what I mean? Like, I don&#39;t want to be talking about tech, like outside of work kind of thing.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Um, so yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** Interesting.

**CT:** I just really, at the end of the day I just really like don&#39;t identify.

**Michelle Chen:** With that.

**CT:** With computer science, so.

**Michelle Chen:** Do you want to?

**CT:** Like I said, I wish I did more like, like--

**Michelle Chen:** Like-- what do you-- what do you think changed your-- like, what happened? Like why?

**CT:** I think it&#39;s like I said, like it was just like a-- like self-reinforcing, like kind of effect.

**Michelle Chen:** [when] you saw all stereotype and you&#39;re like &quot;I don&#39;t want to be that.&quot;

**CT:** Yeah, so then-- I did over compensate it.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** And I, like, made sure I was, like, so distanced.

**Michelle Chen:** From that.

**CT:** From that that I now, like, feel like I don&#39;t have access to enter, like kind of thing.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah, that makes sense. Um, and I guess the last question, pretty big question, but what do you think the CS department can do better? Or like any qualms? Like anything that you feel like you haven&#39;t been able to say? Yeah, because I haven&#39;t asked about it.

**CT:** Um, yeah, I mean I think for me the main thing, like I said, right? It&#39;s, like, honestly just getting better professors, like not just that they&#39;re like--

**Michelle Chen:** Really smart?

**CT:** Archaic and, like, don&#39;t make the field looks super compelling. Um, but like, I honestly can&#39;t really-- I have like, like I said, Hartemink I loved, absolutely loved, um, like Bruce Donald was okay but, otherwise like--

**Michelle Chen:** Like, what&#39;s a good pro-- like, good professor looks like to you?

**CT:** Like, I don&#39;t know, because I haven&#39;t really had them, but like-- well, I mean, so Hartemink, for example. Like, I don&#39;t know, he was just like so clear in all of his lectures, like he made me want to go to his lecture every single day. Like, you know, kind of thing. I would be so interested, like, going to his lectures one and, two, felt like it was worth it for me to go to the lectures because, like, when he didn&#39;t-- like, he lectu-- he didn&#39;t lecture from slides, he, like, did it all on the board kind of thing. Right? So, it&#39;d be missing out if I didn&#39;t go, um, and I-- and he would explain things so clearly that I, like, would get something out of lecture. Like I felt like I was-- you know, like every single time I&#39;d go there we&#39;ll learn a little bit more, a little more. Whereas, every single other one of my CS classes, I&#39;ve-- I&#39;m like, I don&#39;t go, like, you know?

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Because it&#39;s a waste of my time.

**Michelle Chen:** They just read off the sides. It&#39;s so boring and I can do this myself. Like I said, I&#39;m really good at teaching myself and, like, if I&#39;m at a point where, like, you&#39;re boring me in class, I&#39;m not learning anything.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Then, like, I&#39;d rather just spend that time teaching myself.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** And so I haven&#39;t like, you know. Um, also just like, I don&#39;t think they do a good job at all, of like-- obviously, all those classes are so big. And like, I, honestly, like if I were to get a PhD, I wouldn&#39;t have any recommenders because I don&#39;t know any of my CS professors. And I understand that yes, some of that, like, should&#39;ve been on me. Like, I could have flinched, that I could have whatever. But like, I do think that I feel like there are other departments that do a much better job of like--

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah, I agree.

**CT:** Of getting to know their students than the CS professors do.

**Michelle Chen:** Do you think it&#39;s because the department is so big, though? Like, because there&#39;s so many students? Like, for example, like [inaudible], my class advisor and, like, his meetings, like you sign up on, like, an Excel spreadsheet for like a five-minute slot with it.

**CT:** You know, but it&#39;s something like that. I think that&#39;s like, it&#39;s very CS mindset too, right?

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Like &quot;I&#39;m going to automate this process&quot; like, you know, kind of thing, &quot;and make it as efficient as possible.&quot; Like, I think a lot of it does also have to do the fact that the CS professors that we do have are, like, more of the stereotypical, like kind of like awkward, anti-social. Like, you know? Um, and so it&#39;s like I wouldn&#39;t even care to like [flunk] them if I didn&#39;t have any inhibitions, you know, doing that.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** When I&#39;m like one of two hundred students. Like, you know. Um, so the professors, I think, the like kind of like-- how they, like-- they&#39;re pushed to, like, classes, like making them more compelling, like, and relevant and like interdisciplinary kind of thing and, like, practical. But then I think also, I mean I would say, the last thing is maybe, I mean, yeah, I guess for, like, women in particular, like I don&#39;t think they&#39;re very strong offer? It&#39;s like I-- I definitely, like, get the sense that they&#39;re trying to, like, do something about it, but I think what-- their efforts are not very effective. Like, this Wiring With Women group exists. Right?

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Like, is it well attended? I don&#39;t get the sense that it is, not that I&#39;ve ever been, but maybe because I don&#39;t sense that there really is a community there and like, you know? Um, I&#39;ve heard good things about DTech. I don&#39;t know anything about it.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** Right? Like I didn&#39;t-- like we were sophomores when it was [inaudible] and they were all like--

**Michelle Chen:** I don&#39;t even know what that is.

**CT:** Yeah, exactly.

**Michelle Chen:** Is that that D printing thing?

**CT:** No.

**Michelle Chen:** No?

**CT:** Um, no. Um, it&#39;s yeah, whatever; Duke.

**Michelle Chen:** Oh. Is it the women&#39;s thing?

**CT:** Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** Oh!

**CT:** So there are-- there are effort, but, it&#39;s like, I feel like unless you&#39;re part of it, you don&#39;t know anything about it and you don&#39;t have any other resources like, you know, kind of thing.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Um.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah, I think I know what you&#39;re talking about. The one where they help them find internships and [inaudible]--

**CT:** Yeah, and they&#39;re like all in a house together.

**Michelle Chen:** Oh, they live in the house together?

**CT:** Yeah. You know what, so like I think there are efforts and maybe that is an example of, like, where the direction in which they&#39;re going, which is positive and, like, that&#39;s good. But I&#39;m saying like at least for-- for me in my experience, I didn&#39;t really ha-- have that yet.

**Michelle Chen:** It&#39;s so interesting. So, they all live together?

**CT:** Yeah. Um, I felt like there were no resources.

**CT:** Um.

**Michelle Chen:** Interesting. I never-- any of them--

**CT:** Uh, office hours, though. That&#39;s somewhere they could improve.

**Michelle Chen:** What? In what way?

**CT:** Um. I think office hours are supposed to be a space where students who are nervous to, like, ask questions in class and stuff can go and feel comfortable doing that because it&#39;s a, quote unquote, like smaller, more like casual setting.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** But, in my experience, like I&#39;ve said, I&#39;ve only gone to office hours with the full intention of getting help, right? Because I already like don&#39;t like to waste my time.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Like, just going to office hours to go to office hours, you know, kind of thing. So, I&#39;m not-- I-- I&#39;m very like &quot;I go to the [goals], getting my help and I&#39;m going to get my help no matter what&quot; kind of thing. But, um, like when I have gone, I feel like if I didn&#39;t have that-- that attitude, like of like, &quot;I came in here, like, to get homework help and [getting up] my homework help,&quot; like, I would feel so intimidated because, like, it&#39;s a lot of just like-- I mean, and I still do feel intimidated. Like I worked past that, but like, it-- it&#39;s because like, it&#39;s a lot of, um, guys just like commanding, like, the TA&#39;s is attention.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** And if you&#39;re a shy girl who doesn&#39;t feel confident or like whatever, you&#39;re not going to be able to compete with that.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Um, and, for sure, I think they have a lot of guys TAs, which I&#39;ve heard they say like, &quot;Yeah, but it&#39;s like the problem is that, like, there&#39;s not enough female who stay in CS to [BTAs in] the upper levels.&quot; Right? Um, and like the ones who do stay are like the ones who are, like, who excel, like incredibly. So, they&#39;re doing a million other things, you know, and won&#39;t be TAs for us. But like--

**Michelle Chen:** Well, you know, it&#39;s funny because I did an interview with this girl and she was like, &quot;I&#39;ve been trying to be a TA for three semesters.&quot;

**CT:** Oh, really?

**Michelle Chen:** And they just haven&#39;t hired her. And I&#39;m like--

**CT:** So, like it&#39;s--

**Michelle Chen:** So, I--

**CT:** [inaudible] a lot of Asian [inaudible] TAs, too.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah, unlike--

**CT:** Which is problematic.

**Michelle Chen:** [I think]

**CT:** I get that they&#39;re [the] smartest ones in the-- in the-- in the class.

**Michelle Chen:** Like **330** , that sophomore who was a TA, or even he&#39;s a junior.

**CT:** [I didn&#39;t go to any **330**]

**Michelle Chen:** He was so difficult to work with.

**CT:** I did not go to [any] **330**.

**Michelle Chen:** I went all the time. And, they had like a sophomore as one of the TA, and he was like super condescending. He always, every week, he would wear a different tech companies&#39;, like, shirt.

**CT:** Oh, no.

**Michelle Chen:** And then it was just like really hard to ask for help from him because I was-- I mean, he made me feel dumb and I was like &quot;I&#39;m not stupid,&quot; like you know, we talked about this, but like I was just like, &quot;I know I&#39;m not dumb.&quot;

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** But it&#39;s really hard to not feel that way.

**CT:** Asians are, [a lot] less social.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** Look, I&#39;m sorry. But they are.

**Michelle Chen:** They are.

**CT:** Like, they&#39;re more socially awkward and so they just don&#39;t even know how to communicate with you.

**Michelle Chen:** But it&#39;s just like, why? &quot;who hired you?&quot; Like.

**CT:** Yeah, you know what? I would say that, like, the classes that I&#39;ve had that, like, **230** and **260** , I kind of remember they were all guys. I feel like two-- or, like, mostly guys.

**Michelle Chen:** Mhm.

**CT:** But I do feel like there was like a diversity in, like, the type like there was some like athlete TAs and like stuff like that, you know, like whatever. Or like felt like a lot more approachable, like kind of thing.

**Michelle Chen:** Unlike the Asi-- the all-Asian like--

**CT:** Yeah, because when you think of that, like in **250** or like whatever, it&#39;s very much like in **330** , like it&#39;s very much all, like, Asian guys. And, like if you&#39;re just thinking about the stereotype of like what a good like CS, whatever, student is, you&#39;re thinking of that Asian, like whatever.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** So they feel like really inaccessible because you&#39;re like, &quot;oh my God, they&#39;re probably like hell intelligent.&quot; And they are. But, like--

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah.

**CT:** You know, like, and then you&#39;re too nervous to like, I don&#39;t know, approach them or something.

**Michelle Chen:** Yeah. Oh, whoa. [Inaudible]. Mhm. Well, that is-- those are all my ques-- is there anything else you?

**CT:** No.

**Michelle Chen:** Thank you.

**CT:** Yeah.

**Michelle Chen:** For doing this. Truly. That&#39;s all I have. I&#39;m like [inaudible].

**CT:** Yeah, I don&#39;t know.

**Michelle Chen:** Um, I will send you-- I&#39;ll pause this now. Whoa! This is the longest interview. I&#39;ve done--
